‍**20 SEPTEMBER, 2024:** [CloudInteract](https://www.cloudinteract.io/), a rapidly growing, UK-based provider of customer experience (CX) platforms, announces a range of senior hires to support its UK growth plans and expansion into the US market.

Founded by customer workplace communications experts, Nick Seagrave and Simon Leyland, CloudInteract was launched in 2023 and provides customers, including education provider, Pearson, life sciences enterprises, and online consumer services, such as Swoop, with innovative CX software, as well as supporting industry partners, such as Amazon Web Services.  

CloudInteract works with businesses to help unlock data insights and enable smarter communication.  

Through the delivery of AI-driven platforms and omni-channel systems, CloudInteract empowers companies to scale and continuously adapt to their evolving customer service needs.

**Simon Leyland**, **CEO** and **Co-founder** of **CloudInteract**, explains, “CloudInteract was born out of Nick’s and my mission to reimagine customer experience, by making contact centre interactions better for both customers and users alike. We understand that in a world full of technology providers, the difference lies in how that technology is used to transform real-world experiences.”

The growth achieved by CloudInteract in under two years has been attributed to the company’s ability to empower businesses to reimagine and transform customer interactions.

“We’ve seen tremendous growth in a short period because the businesses we work with recognise the importance of enhancing customer interactions to drive tangible value,” continued **Simon**.

In support of its UK growth plans and expansion of its US presence, CloutInteract has onboarded new talent to its now 50% female senior leadership team.

The CX platform provider recently welcomed Louise Mahrra as Marketing Director, Nancy Van Delist as Head of Business, North America and Julian Degg as UK Head of Business Development. They will work alongside Change Director, Eliza Taylor and co-founders, Chief Technology Officer, Nick Seagrave and CEO Simon Leyland.

As CloudInteract expands its operations and brings in new talent to support strategic growth in an industry predicted to mature to over [USD 22 billion](https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/customer-service-software-market) by 2030, the company’s founders and newly appointed senior team are firmly fixated on helping businesses unlock the full potential of their customer experience platforms by turning every interaction into a competitive advantage.

**Simon** added, “Our growth is fuelled by a dedication to reimagining what customer experience can be. By doubling down on our investment in people, partnerships, and platforms, we’re positioning CloudInteract as the go-to partner for businesses that want to unlock the power of AI, data, and communication to transform their customer interactions.”

“CloudInteract has set an ambitious growth target of achieving £5m in revenue by March 2026, having already exceeded mid-year revenue growth in the first half of 2024. The company is also on track to double its headcount by March 2026, with an additional 25 hires planned across both the UK and US to support continued expansion and customer success,” concluded **Simon**.
