At CloudInteract, we believe that exceptional customer service shouldn’t be complicated. It should be seamless: for your customers, your agents, and your IT team. That’s why I’m excited to share how we’re bringing Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams together in a way that removes barriers, simplifies interactions, and empowers your team to deliver their best.

  

![Tom Morgan](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Tom%20Morgan.jpg)In this blog, I’ll walk you through how our Microsoft Teams integration for Amazon Connect transforms your contact centre strategy; without the usual headaches, hidden costs, or complex setups.[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmorganuk/)

#### Why Settle for Less? Level Up Your Contact Centre with:

1.  **No Extra Licensing Required**

Customer service should enhance your brand, not drain your budget. Our integration means your agents can seamlessly transfer PSTN calls from Amazon Connect directly to Microsoft Teams - without needing a Teams Phone licence for every user.

*   Calls are routed through our secure bridging service, arriving directly in Teams.
*   Your agents can reach anyone in your organisation quickly and easily.

2.  **Swarm Chat – Expert Support in Real Time**

![Picture3](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Picture3.png)Your best problem-solvers shouldn’t be locked behind tech barriers. With Swarm Chat, agents can pull in the right experts instantly, right in the middle of a call.

*   Start a secure, multi-party chat in Teams - no delays, no confusion.
*   Solve complex issues by bringing everyone who matters into the conversation.
*   Secure, compliant, and fully tracked inside Teams.

The result? Faster issue resolution, more satisfied customers.

3.  **Presence-Aware Transfer – Smart Connections, Every Time**

![Picture4](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Picture4.png)Nothing frustrates a customer more than being passed to someone who isn’t available. Our integration solves this by showing agents the live Teams status of every contact.

*   See who’s available in real-time before transferring a call.
*   Make smart, fast transfers without leaving customers in limbo.

#### How It Works - Simplicity on the Surface, Seamlessness Behind the Scenes

Our integration is designed to be intuitive for agents and robust for IT.

*   **Customer calls via PSTN**, routed to Amazon Connect.
*   **Agents answer through Amazon Connect’s CCP**, embedded in our custom portal.
*   **Need expert help?** Agents launch Swarm Chat in Teams with a single click.
*   **Seamless escalation:** Calls are securely routed to Teams without complex setups.
*   **Smart transfers:** Agents see Teams user availability, making intelligent handoffs.

#### The Benefits at a Glance:

*   No extra Teams Phone licenses.
*   No cross-platform confusion for agents or IT.
*   Secure, compliant, and fully trackable interactions.
