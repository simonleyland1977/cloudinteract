#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### I joined in October 2023.  

#### What was your first day like? 

##### I was added to Teams and welcomed via the Company Chat channel, introduced myself to everyone with a bit of a backstory of myself. Everyone was extremely welcoming and the jokes/humour came out straight away. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

I have had been on the receiving end of the consultancy for a number of years and was always frustrated with the way projects were delivered as it always felt like they would build something based on a set of requirements and just hand it over instead of fully understanding the requirements, offering their expertise on the subject and working with us to build it.  For me, working here means I get to do what I always wanted to receive, providing experience from various other clients to solve problems and work with the client so they know how its built and provide feedback throughout the project to ensure what is delivered is the best possible solution.

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### Using my past experience working with the business and agents from producing schedules, generating reports, making BAU telephone changes through to large scale telephony deployment projects. I listen to the customer to understand what their end goal is, translate that to technical requirements and determine the best way to architect the solution.

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### I really enjoy making Agents and End Customers' lives easier! I get really frustrated with poorly structured Contact Centres (as I'm sure a lot of people do!) and love being able to improve that as much as possible with Technology.

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### Start of the day is checking and updating any issues that we may have outstanding, the rest of the day is then usually split out between building services and catching up with Clients to give updates/demo's etc to get continuous feedback and finally I usually also reach out to a few people for non-work conversations/catch ups.

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### Internal ChatGPT - the ability to automatically know everything!

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### Chicken Tikka Vindaloo with pilau rice and keema naan!

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### Capybara - Everyone would think I'm super cute and have my own song...
