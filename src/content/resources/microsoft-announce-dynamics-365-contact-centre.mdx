At CloudInteract, we are excited to bring you news of a change that Microsoft are making to their Dynamics 365 offering, that will open it up to many more people.  

Microsoft are splitting apart the capabilities of their omni-channel contact centre experience from their CRM solution. This means that organisations can now choose to deploy a Microsoft-based contact centre solution without needing to move their CRM to Dynamics.  

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Centre is infused with Copilot and promises to transform customer service experiences with its generative AI capabilities, elevating your customer engagement to new heights. As an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) and Microsoft Partner, we are here to guide you, helping you evaluate this offering and deploy the solution tailored to your business needs.

At CloudInteract we view Amazon, Zoom and Microsoft to have the necessary scale and technical capabilities to provide the next generation of customer experience.  It is a welcome development from Microsoft that they taking the necessary steps to allow Enterprise customers to take advantage of Microsoft’s combined scale of global telephony/video and AI without the need to have Dynamics CRM.

#### Embracing the Future of Customer Service with Generative AI

Generative AI is a game-changer for customer service. It transforms how contact centres operate, enabling customers to resolve their own needs while equipping agents with relevant context. As a result, businesses can drive efficiency, reduce costs, and deliver outstanding customer experiences.

Microsoft's own Customer Service and Support (CSS) team has already experienced the transformative power of this technology. By integrating Copilot, they achieved significant efficiency improvements, including a 31 percent increase in first call resolution and a 20 percent reduction in missed routes.

Dynamics 365 Contact Centre: The Next Evolution of Customer Service

Drawing from Microsoft's successful implementation of Copilot, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Centre integrates generative AI throughout the contact centre workflow. This solution helps solve problems faster, empower agents, and reduces costs. Built natively on the Microsoft cloud, Dynamics 365 Contact Centre provides scalability and reliability across various channels while preserving your existing investments in CRM or custom apps.

Key features include:

*   **Next-generation self-service**: Leveraging pre-integrated Copilots for digital and voice channels, Dynamics 365 Contact Centre enables rich self-service experiences powered by generative AI.

*   **Accelerated human-assisted service**: Intelligent routing directs incoming requests to the most suitable agent, enhancing service quality and efficiency. Agents are equipped with a 360-degree view of the customer, enabling them to provide superior service.

*   **Operational efficiency**: With real-time reporting, Dynamics 365 Contact Centre allows leaders to optimize contact centre operations across all support channels.

The general availability of Dynamics 365 Contact Centre begins on July 1.
