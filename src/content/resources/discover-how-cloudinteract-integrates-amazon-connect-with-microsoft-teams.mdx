At CloudInteract, we understand that delivering seamless customer experiences is a key challenge for many organisations. For businesses using Amazon Connect, offering quick and easy connections through chat widgets is a powerful first step. By enabling customers to engage in meaningful conversations with bots that understand their needs, organisations can quickly route customers to the right agents, improving efficiency and response times.

While text can provide clarity, there are moments when a picture - or even better, a video - speaks louder than words. In certain industries, such as private banking or healthcare, visual communication can significantly improve service quality, reduce misunderstandings, and allow agents to better assist customers by observing non-verbal cues.

Despite the clear benefits of video, many businesses are reluctant to introduce new platforms, especially when they’ve already invested in a trusted tool like Microsoft Teams for internal communications. The challenge is clear: how can we offer the advantages of video without disrupting the flow of existing communications?

At CloudInteract, we know that juggling multiple tools can overwhelm both IT teams and agents. In fact, a recent survey found that over 55% of contact centre leaders attribute agent attrition to difficulties with managing multiple tools. That’s why we’ve found a way to [integrate Amazon Connect with Microsoft Teams](/resource-hub/combining-amazon-connect-and-microsoft-teams-video-to-enhance-customer-experience) in a way that brings the best of both worlds together - without adding unnecessary complexity.

#### **Combining Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams: A Solution You Can Trust**

![Manage icon-100](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Manage%20icon-100.jpg)With years of experience delivering tailored solutions for complex customer interactions, CloudInteract has mastered the art of blending Amazon Connect’s robust chat functionality with the power of Microsoft Teams for voice and video calls. Here’s how it works:

*   Customers can continue to start conversations through Amazon Connect's chat widget, engaging with bots to clarify their needs before being routed to the right agent.
*   For many interactions, chat alone is sufficient. However, when a more personal or detailed discussion is needed, agents can easily escalate the conversation to voice or video without leaving their familiar interface.
*   The integration allows both customer and agent to join a video call through their browser - no apps, plugins, or downloads necessary - using Microsoft Teams. And because the meeting is hosted on your Microsoft Teams tenant, everything remains secure and compliant, in line with your internal policies.

For organisations that don’t use Microsoft Teams, we offer alternatives like Azure Communication Services, which provide secure, scalable video solutions within the Microsoft Azure environment.

#### **Real-World Example: Improving Customer Experience with Video**

Take the example of a customer seeking mortgage advice. After receiving a quotation via email, they have follow-up questions that could take considerable time to address through chat. With CloudInteract’s solution, the advisor can seamlessly switch from chat to a video call, offering a much richer and clearer explanation of the mortgage details.

The advisor clicks a button in Amazon Connect to generate a Teams meeting, and a link is sent to the customer to join the call. The advisor can then share their screen, walk the customer through the document, and resolve any questions in real-time. The entire conversation is automatically logged in Amazon Connect, ensuring valuable insights are preserved for future reference.
