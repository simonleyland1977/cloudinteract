## **Meet Bentley Paton**

**![Bentley](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/People%20Pictures/Bentley.jpg)Meet Bentley, CloudInteract’s AWS Platform Architect -** master of all things AWS, Amazon Connect, and the occasional Chinese takeaway. With a favorite quote that sums up adulthood, Bentley blends humor, expertise, and a love for cats (he’s convinced they’re hiding the secrets of the universe). Whether he’s automating contact centres or dreaming of teleportation for quicker noodle runs, Bentley’s impact on the team and customers is anything but typical.

#### Favourite Quote: 

“No one else knows what they are doing either.” Ricky Gervais

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### Since March 2022 

#### What was your first day like? 

##### As we’re remote, I had a few calls to meet and get to know my colleagues and then I was straight onto working with our first client, focused on building tools to help automate their contact centre deployments. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

I’ve been building customer experience focused solutions with AWS and Amazon Connect for the last 6 years. Working at CloudInteract allows me to do that with a team of extremely talented people and enjoy what I do every day. Joining CloudInteract in startup phase has given me the chance to have a real impact on both the company and our customers. 

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### I often just say that I do all things AWS and Amazon Connect – It’s hard to describe exactly what I do, my main areas of focus at CloudInteract are Python development, infrastructure and automation, AWS development and Amazon Connect. The overall objective is to improve customer and employee experience through technology. 

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### I’m part of an extremely talented team of people that are great to work with, we have a range of projects meaning that the work is varied and keeps me engaged. 

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### I think a typical day for most people at a remote company looks quite similar – but the work that I do can vary, so usually I have a few meetings and then time to work on projects. We also try to make sure there’s some time for everyone to get together and talk about non-work things.   

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### I think teleportation would be a lot of fun and the possibilities are endless  

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### I’m always up for a Chinese restaurant/takeaway 

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### Probably a cat, I’ve had cats for most of my life and they’ve always been very happy. I think we share some common ground and I’d love to know what they’re thinking.
