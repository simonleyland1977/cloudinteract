#### Welcome to our series: Momentum: The Change Journey! 

[Eliza Taylor | Change Director](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliza-taylor-696bb636/vvv)

Change isn’t just about new technology or processes - it’s about people. Momentum: The Change Journey is a series dedicated to unlocking the power of effective change management, helping organisations move from resistance to readiness, and ensuring that transformation sticks. Through expert insights, practical strategies, and real-world stories, we’ll explore how to build adoption momentum and create lasting impact.

Change is an essential part of growth for any organisation, but let’s face it - change often meets resistance. Whether you’re introducing new strategies, technologies, or processes, the key is to transform that resistance into readiness.

Explain the Why

It may sound odd, but sometimes leaders skip the '**why**' and dive straight into the '**what**'. But that 'why' is the golden key to your success (or without it, the start of a bumpy ride).

Words like “improvement”, “efficiency”, or “optimisation” just won't cut it. There's always a bigger picture. Are you moving resources into new strategic areas, aiming for a fresh market or product, trying to keep pace with competitors, shaking off legacy tech no longer fit-for-purpose, or charting a bold, new direction for the company? Share that story with your people!

And here’s the kicker: Your business is probably juggling multiple changes at once. Aligning all these initiatives with your high-level goals makes everything feel like part of a grand plan, rather than a chaotic jigsaw puzzle.

#### Listen Up

![Bullhorn icon](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Bullhorn%20icon.png)Big announcements from key leaders are a great start, but let’s be real – they're just the tip of the iceberg. Think about how many unread emails are sitting in your inbox right now. You can't just drop a bombshell and walk away.

You need a steady stream of communication throughout your project. This isn’t just to keep everyone in the loop; it’s to keep the excitement alive, gauge reactions, and build momentum as you rack up those wins.

Take a broad approach when it comes to engagement and communication. Don’t just engage stakeholders; dive into employee forums, arrange Q&A sessions (like roadshows or lunch n’ learns), and recruit champions who can spread the word in every corner of your business.

Opening up two-way communication channels takes effort, but it’s worth it. It’s not just about making sure your workforce feels heard; sometimes, you’ll get critical insights that stop the project derailing. Trust me, those red flags have saved the day more than once!

#### Idealism Meets Realism

_“This is our most important internal initiative – budget is no issue, just get it done well.”_ Said almost no company, ever.

Business is business, and the reality often involves tight resources and teams stretched thin. You still need to get everyone on board with the change, making sure they’re actively involved while juggling their daily tasks, but you don’t have endless time or resources to make this happen.

Balancing ideal solutions with practical constraints is key. In a perfect world, you’d have custom workshops, face-to-face engagement, plenty of incentives, and bespoke training for every part of the business that everyone attends. But let's face it, most projects can’t hit all those marks.

![Journey icon](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Journey%20icon.png)So, use your resources wisely. Focus on what truly makes a difference. If time and people are in short supply, think about a train-the-trainer approach to spread the knowledge. Prioritise workshops for the folks who will feel the impact the most. Even if you can't create the perfect experience, aim to make a real difference where it counts.

#### Can You be Trusted?

Let’s be honest – everyone has at least one example of a poor change experience, where cryptic messaging and emergency action delivered lots of pain with very little benefit.

Trust reduces resistance. You want employees to trust that their leaders care about the impact and are being as transparent and supportive as they can, even when they are facing the toughest decisions. This isn’t about ‘spinning’ the story – trust significantly affects your ability to keep talent and do business, as well as how agile you can be in change.

Make sure you deliver, if you say that employees will be consulted, trained and supported – believe me, employees will definitely notice if they aren't.

#### Maintaining Momentum

![Chatbot icon](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Chatbot%20icon.png)Recognise that change takes effort. It’s not always easy, but it's worth it. Acknowledge those who jump in with both feet. Celebrate small wins. As change fatigue grows, you can rejuvenate your programme by highlighting teams that are making progress, using them as positive examples of future benefits.

When things get bumpy (and they will), tackle problems constructively and with understanding. Nobody wants a blame game – we all want solutions and a chance to learn from mistakes without fear of being singled out.  Fear will grow resistance.

Making change happen isn’t just about implementing new processes or systems – it’s about creating an environment where people feel proud, motivated, and ready to tackle the future. Keep the energy high, communication flowing, and celebrate those wins. Your enthusiasm will be contagious, and soon you’ll have a team that’s not just ready for change but ready for it.

#### Conclusion

Turning resistance into readiness isn’t a walk in the park, but it’s definitely doable with the right approach. Picture this: a clear vision, open and honest communication, and plenty of feedback flying back and forth. Show your team you appreciate their hard work, build trust by standing by your promises, and get everyone from top to bottom involved.

Above all, your company, your people and your change are unique. There isn’t a cookie-cutter fix all. You need to take the time, every time, to understand your context to authentically address resistance.
