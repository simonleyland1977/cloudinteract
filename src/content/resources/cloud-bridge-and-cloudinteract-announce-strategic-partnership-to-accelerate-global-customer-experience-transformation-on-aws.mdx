**11 June 2025** — **Cloud Bridge** and **CloudInteract**, Two leading AWS Partners, today announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the delivery of AI-powered, cloud-native contact centre solutions for organisations worldwide. This collaboration brings together the scale and cloud expertise of Cloud Bridge, the deep Amazon Connect specialism of CloudInteract, and the transformative capabilities of **AWS**, forming a powerhouse alliance to reimagine customer experience across industries.

Under the new partnership, [Cloud Bridge](https://www.cloud-bridge.co.uk/) and CloudInteract will jointly deliver a suite of intelligent customer engagement solutions built on **Amazon Connect**, combining rapid deployment accelerators, generative AI, and deep CX insight to enable businesses to move faster, scale smarter, and serve better — globally.

“This is about the power of three: the global reach and cloud transformation strength of Cloud Bridge, the Amazon Connect expertise and AI innovation of CloudInteract, and the capabilities of AWS,” said [**Adam Thornton, CRO & Co-Founder at Cloud Bridge**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-thornton-0653bb2/). “Together, we can help organisations unlock customer experience that’s not only smarter and scalable — but truly built for the future.”

The partnership strengthens both companies’ positions as AWS leaders in their domains. Cloud Bridge, an **AWS Premier Consulting Partner**, brings proven delivery in cloud migration, modernisation, and FinOps, with over 130 workloads migrated and $10M+ in monthly AWS spend optimised in 2024 alone. CloudInteract, an **Advanced AWS Partner** with 7 Amazon Connect Ambassadors, complements this with tailored CX strategy, embedded AI capabilities, and their award-winning **Apollo** analytics platform.

The joint offer includes the **Amazon Connect QuickStart** — a three-week production deployment designed to give organisations a rapid, low-risk route to modernising their contact centres and embedding AI-powered capabilities from day one.

“At CloudInteract, our mission is simple — to make customer experience better. We believe there’s no excuse for bad service, and no reason why any organisation should settle for it,” said [**Simon Leyland, CEO & Co-founder at CloudInteract**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonleyland/). “We exist to reimagine how people connect with brands — not just through technology, but through meaningful outcomes. This partnership with Cloud Bridge strengthens our ability to deliver that vision at scale and pace, globally.”

This partnership also aligns with AWS’s strategic focus on **Unlimited AI** and the evolution of **next-generation Amazon Connect**. By combining deep partner expertise and AWS innovation, clients gain access to cutting-edge tools, scalable AI capabilities, and a proven path to delivering smarter, more human customer experiences.
