# Unlocking the Power of Generative AI – One Step at a Time

By Nick Seagrave, Chief Technology Officer, CloudInteract

**Welcome to _Tech Talk: Cutting Through the Hype_**  
In this series, I'll lift the lid on the hype and cut through the hyperbole surrounding the technologies they claim will revolutionise our industry.

But let's be real: not everything that glitters is gold. Each post will cut through the noise and give you the straight talk you need to make informed decisions for your organisation. Expect no jargon - just honest insights, practical advice, and a clear look at what’s worth your time and investment in the tech landscape. Let’s separate fact from fiction and get to the heart of what really matters.

### The Future of Contact Centres: Why AI Isn’t Magic, But It Can Be a Game-Changer

Let’s get one thing straight: AI isn’t some magic button you press to solve all your problems overnight. I’ve been around long enough to know that every shiny new tech promises the world, but the reality is often far less glamorous. Sure, Generative AI has the potential to transform customer service, but it’s not going to replace everything you have in place by tomorrow morning. If you’re expecting that, you’ll be disappointed. The key here is building a solid foundation first — laying the groundwork that allows AI to do what it does best, gradually, based on real data.

### Start Where You Are, Not Where You Want to Be

Businesses I speak with worry that embracing AI means scrapping everything they’ve worked to build. I get it. There’s a lot of fear out there about rushing into something before you’re ready. It reminds me of the early days of unified communications when everyone thought we’d all be wearing headsets 24/7. That didn’t happen overnight either, did it?

The fact is, most contact centres today are still voice-driven. Your agents are handling calls, your customers are comfortable with the way things work (mostly), and that’s okay. You don’t need to tear everything down to move forward. What we do at CloudInteract is take what you’ve got — those voice systems that are still doing the heavy lifting - and build on them. AI isn’t about replacing; it’s about enhancing. You need to start by understanding what’s happening today before you start automating everything tomorrow.

### Data First, AI Later

Here’s the thing: AI is only as good as the data you feed it. So before you get carried away with ideas of AI-driven customer interactions and fully automated workflows, you need to start by analysing what’s really going on in your contact centre. Look at your call data. What are your agents dealing with day in and day out? Where are the repetitive tasks? Are your customers getting stuck in self-service loops or needing human intervention more often than you think?

That’s where we come in. We can take your existing call data - everything from how long people are on hold to how many times they transfer to a live agent - and start to make sense of it. From there, we can figure out where AI would actually make an impact. Maybe it’s automating responses for simple enquiries, or maybe it’s something more complex. But the point is, we don’t know until we look at the data.

### The AI Utopia Can Wait

Everyone likes to talk about the potential of AI to revolutionise customer service, and while that future is exciting, it’s not today. AI is not a teleportation device that magically zaps you into a fully autonomous world. It’s a tool that helps you get there one step at a time. That’s why our approach is to work with the systems you already have in place, integrating AI where it makes sense, not where it sounds cool.

Think of it like a diagnostic tool. You wouldn’t try to fix something without first understanding the problem, would you? AI can help you analyse your current operations and identify the best opportunities for improvement. It’s not about _replacing_ your agents; it’s about **supporting** them, offering real-time insights, automating the mundane stuff, and giving them the tools to perform at their best.

### The Real World Benefits of AI – When Used Correctly

When implemented thoughtfully, Generative AI can drive significant improvements in your contact centre. McKinsey’s research shows it can increase productivity by up to 45% in customer service functions. But that’s not the whole story. The true value comes from personalised, efficient interactions that make your customers feel heard and valued. It’s about resolving issues faster and giving your agents the support they need to excel.

But again, all of this starts with a foundation - understanding where you are today, analysing the data, and moving forward strategically. AI isn’t about jumping ahead; it’s about smart, incremental improvements that make a real difference to your business.

### My Final Thoughts…

If you’re nervous about AI, you’re not alone. But don’t let that fear stop you from exploring its potential. We’ll help you bring your current systems into the future, one step at a time, and ensure that you’re making decisions based on what’s really happening in your contact centre. No hype, just a data-driven approach to making your operations smoother and more efficient. And yes, if you’re wondering, it’s possible to do all this without turning your world upside down.
