## Total Experience - The Pathway to Digital Transformation

Keeping up with the ever-evolving technological landscape is one of the biggest challenges facing companies today. Digital transformation is now a necessity, but knowing how, when and which areas to prioritise can result in an inefficient and protracted process, and a disengaged workforce.

For customer-facing organisations, this can be catastrophic.

Total Experience (TX), or Multi-experience (MX) is the response to consumers' growing expectation of a consistent, smooth and satisfying journey across all touchpoints, and employees’ expectation of digital tooling in the workplace to self-serve, collaborate and progress in their careers. Covering the full range of experiences, from digital to physical channels and back again, TX addresses how the business operates so that the values of quality, performance and satisfaction pervade from the inside out.

In this article, we'll break down what Total Experience is, and how digital transformation helps businesses to achieve it.

### What Is Total Experience?

> Covering UX, AX, EX and CX (user experience, agent experience, employee and customer experience), Total Experience enables organisations to stay on the pulse of their workforce, the marketplace, and the industry in which they work through the capabilities of modern technology.

### Knowing What Your Customers Want

Learning about people’s needs and desires is the first step towards providing a Total Experience. This calls for an in-depth familiarity with their tastes, problems, habits and communication preferences. Digitisation has opened up a world of data capture opportunity, enabling deep and multi-faceted analysis of every scrap of customer behaviour.  

There’s no need for guesswork – the evidence speaks for itself and provides a solid footing for forecasting, decision-making and future investment.

### Making Use of New Technology

Cutting-edge tools drive Total Experience, improving digital interactions and expediting business processes. For example, the use of artificial intelligence in chatbots and virtual assistants accelerates the process of locating relevant information during client interactions and, as an added bonus, reduces reliance on human support by answering common questions, freeing up agents to develop their skills by concentrating on more intricate problems.

Machine learning extends the capabilities of AI, with every experience contributing to its growing understanding of human behaviour, and its ability to anticipate change and pinpoint opportunities.

These same principles can be applied to employee experience apps and platforms; using tech for the heavy lifting as well as the mundane tasks, putting knowledge and skills-building at the forefront of everyday work and bringing wellbeing into the picture with a range of tools to support, relax, and add focus, tailored specifically to the needs of the individual.

### An Integrated Approach to Digital Transformation

The first step to attaining a Total Experience is to create a comprehensive digital transformation strategy that encompasses all relevant stakeholders and departments. All the resources and abilities required for carrying out the transition must be determined and planned for at this stage.

And from concept to execution, a good digital transformation strategy must put the customer first, ensuring their expectations and demands are addressed throughout the business transformation process.

### Continuous Journey Improvement

Last but not least, businesses that aim for the nirvana of Total Experience must constantly review and enhance the quality of their customers' experiences. This calls for a data-driven strategy that monitors all customer touchpoints to pinpoint problem areas and anticipate changes in behaviour.

By responding to areas of frustration shown by customer feedback and data analytics, businesses can lessen the impact by acting quickly and appropriately. This may involve making changes to the site's structure, the buying process, or the methods by which customers approach the company for help.

### Conclusion - Why Total Experience?

Whilst its purpose is to support a seamless and consistent user journey, the reality is that companies can have a lot of fun with Total Experience, and embrace all its benefits across voice, touch, vision and motion. From fully immersive experiences with augmented/virtual reality to lightning-fast apps and entertaining wearables, Total Experience thrives on interaction, and powers organisations forward with direct influence from the customer base.

It’s clear that organisations must put a premium on Total Experience as part of their digital transformation efforts if they’re to stay competitive and relevant. Total Experience provides the ability to generate revenue growth by gaining a deep understanding of the current and future customer, embracing new technologies, developing holistic transformation strategy, and continuously monitoring and optimising the customer journey.
