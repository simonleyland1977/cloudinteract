In today’s hybrid, fast-moving customer service environment, seamless communication isn’t just helpful - it’s critical. Contact centre agents need to collaborate with internal teams in real time, whether they're resolving a customer query, escalating a technical issue, or seeking product expertise.

That’s why our engineering team at **CloudInteract** has been working on a powerful integration between **Microsoft Teams and Amazon Connect**, designed to streamline collaboration for agents and reduce the time it takes to resolve customer issues.

In this short but impactful video demo, Muhammad from our Engineering team walks through some of the key capabilities and gives a preview of what’s coming next.

#### Key Features Demonstrated

1\. Native Teams Chat within Amazon Connect  
Agents can now send messages to colleagues directly within the Amazon Connect interface using Microsoft Teams. Whether it’s a quick 1:1 message or a group chat, this feature helps agents collaborate without switching platforms.  
  
2\. Seamless Call Transfer to Microsoft Teams Users  
Need to bring in a subject matter expert mid-call? No problem. The demo shows how agents can initiate an outbound customer call, then add a colleague from Microsoft Teams into the conversation—using just one number, regardless of PSTN status.  
  
3\. Real-Time Agent and Team Status Visibility  
Visibility into team availability is crucial in high-volume contact centres. The integration provides live status updates for agents and teams, helping everyone stay aligned and know who’s available at a glance.  
  
4\. What’s Coming Next: Agent Presence Synchronisation  
Muhammad also gives a sneak peek into upcoming functionality: full presence synchronisation. Soon, agents’ status updates in Amazon Connect will reflect in Microsoft Teams—and vice versa—ensuring alignment across both platforms.

#### Why This Matters

Contact centres are evolving fast, and so are customer expectations. Integrations like this one help break down communication silos, empower frontline agents, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.  
  
Whether you're managing a customer service team, overseeing IT infrastructure, or driving digital transformation across your organisation, this kind of unified communications solution can dramatically improve operational efficiency.
