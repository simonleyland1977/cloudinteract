## AWS Named a Leader in Forrester Wave for CCaaS

Amazon Connect has been recognised as a Leader in the latest Forrester Wave for Contact Centre as a Service (CCaaS). The platform achieved top scores in areas such as AI architecture, generative AI support, pricing flexibility, and innovation. It also received above-average ratings in customer feedback, underlining its growing impact in real-world contact centre environments.

## Mass Notifications Now Supported for Outbound Campaigns

Amazon Connect now enables event-driven outbound campaigns designed for mass notifications. This supports use cases such as severe weather alerts or public safety messages. To use this feature, AWS requires pre-authorisation via a support ticket to ensure appropriate and responsible use.

## New Calendar View for Agent Adherence 

Supervisors can now view agent schedule adherence in a calendar format, offering a more intuitive way to monitor performance. The new interface allows you to spot and filter adherence breaches by agent, date, and duration, with up to 90 days of history. This provides a clearer picture of team trends and enables more informed management decisions.

## Contact Lens Expands Language Support

Amazon Connect Contact Lens now supports an additional 34 languages, including Arabic, Cantonese, Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Vietnamese, and more. This expanded coverage allows organisations to apply analytics and insights across a wider customer base. Support levels may vary by feature, so it’s recommended to check compatibility by language.  
👉 [See the full list of supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/supported-languages.html#supported-languages-contact-lens)

## Configurable Wait Times for IVR Input 

A new update allows you to customise the wait time between DTMF inputs in IVR menus. The interval can now be adjusted between 1 and 20 seconds (previously fixed at 5 seconds), offering greater flexibility in designing customer input flows.  
👉 [Read more about IVR configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/store-customer-input.html)

## Greater Control Over Sentiment Analysis in Contact Lens 

Organisations can now enable or disable sentiment analysis independently within Contact Lens. This means you can continue to use other analytics features while turning off sentiment scoring, providing more nuanced control over how customer interactions are assessed.  
👉 [Customise sentiment analysis settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/enable-analytics.html#disable-sentiment-analysis-voice-and-chat)

## SLA Tracking Now Available for Amazon Connect Cases 

A significant addition to Amazon Connect Cases is the ability to set and monitor service level agreements (SLAs). Admins can define SLA rules based on case attributes, establish resolution targets, and set up escalation rules. Agents and supervisors can view SLA status in real time, helping teams prioritise effectively and meet customer expectations.  
👉 [Get started with SLA tracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/cases-sla.html)

## Improved Access Control for Reporting 

Reporting access can now be limited by agent hierarchy, allowing managers to see only the data relevant to their teams. This granular access control supports better governance, particularly in larger or multi-team environments, and complements existing tagging-based controls for agents, queues, and routing profiles.  
👉 [Learn how to configure access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/dashboard-access-control.html)

## Amazon Bedrock Prompt Optimisation and Caching Now Generally Available 

Two enhancements from Amazon Bedrock are now generally available: prompt optimisation and prompt caching. Prompt optimisation rewrites user inputs for improved inference results, while caching reduces latency and input token costs. These capabilities further enhance performance and efficiency in generative AI workloads.
