Last week, we had the privilege of joining our partners TD SYNNEX and AWS, along with a number of other industry partners, for their Partner Update Briefing (PUB) session in London. The event provided a platform to discuss the immense value of collaboration and how strong partnerships can lead to better outcomes for our customers.

The key takeaway from the session? Despite the buzz around emerging technologies like Generative AI, many businesses are still taking cautious steps toward adoption.

Why is that? According to IDC, the biggest challenge many businesses face is the shortage of cloud skills within their teams. Gartner adds that companies simply cannot hire and train fast enough to keep pace with the evolving tech landscape. As a result, businesses and their customers are missing out on valuable opportunities to enhance the customer experience due to a lack of internal expertise.

On the flip side, confidence in the success of transformation projects is critical before diving into new technologies. AWS shared that there was a 65% increase in cloud budgets during the pandemic, but challenges persist - 38% of cloud migration projects finish behind schedule, and a staggering 75% exceed their budget. This highlights the need for trusted, experienced partners who can manage projects effectively and ensure ROI. Businesses are looking for partners who can deliver on their promises and demonstrate clear value to both their customers and their bottom line.

After the session, we gathered at Flight Club for a bit of fun and networking, where we also got the chance to demonstrate our darts skills (or lack thereof!) over drinks and nibbles. In true gamification style, it was an enjoyable and inclusive experience that brought people together. Interestingly, while the gamification experience was engaging, it was clear that AI was working behind the scenes, enhancing the smoothness and enjoyment of the experience without being overt. And that’s exactly how AI should feel - seamless and intuitive.

At CloudInteract, we’ve embraced AI as a core part of our service offerings. By leveraging AI to analyse contact centre data, we gain deep insights into customer journeys and identify areas for improvement. Where are the friction points in your customer journeys? What repetitive tasks could be automated? Which solutions (e.g., CRM) do your agents need to interact with, and how can we better serve your customers? By understanding these elements, we can provide a clear, actionable roadmap to optimise your customer experience and ensure you achieve the ROI you expect.

If you're ready to discover how AI can transform your customer experience, let’s talk. We’re here to help you make informed decisions, streamline processes, and deliver exceptional results.
