The buzz around Amazon Connect continues to grow, and the recent **Independent Amazon Connect User Group** event in London, spearheaded by **John Ing**, founder of the group, was a testament to the platform's expanding community. The event brought together a dynamic mix of AWS experts, industry leaders, and solution providers to share insights, foster collaboration, and tackle common challenges in the contact centre space.

Here’s a look at the highlights, key themes, and valuable lessons from the day.

### **A Platform for Collaboration and Best Practices**

[John Ing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingjohn/) set the tone early, emphasising the group’s mission: “Bringing the right people together to collaborate, learn, and share.” This sentiment resonated throughout the day as attendees exchanged real-world insights about deploying and optimising Amazon Connect.

“It’s a growing band of people,” John noted. “The idea is to help each other maximise the value of investments we’ve made in using Connect or helping others use it.”

The event attracted a diverse mix of attendees, with numbers slightly up from the first gathering. As Alex Baker observed, “It’s great to see new faces and sponsors. The attendance reflects the value of events like this - getting partners and customers to share tips and tricks.”

### **Innovative Solutions on Display**

The event showcased cutting-edge solutions built on Amazon Connect. [**Ruben Opdenakker**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruben-opdenakker/), Head of Product Management at Mobile Connect, shared insights on their mobile application designed to integrate Amazon Connect capabilities for mobile workforces.

“We’re serving people outside the contact centre - salespeople, field technicians, anyone making or receiving customer calls while mobile,” Ruben explained. The app’s seamless integration and WebRTC-first design allow users to leverage Amazon Connect telephony on the go, with PSTN backup for unreliable internet connections.

For Ruben, the biggest industries adopting their solution are **healthcare**, **insurance**, and **banking**, with key markets in the UK and US. “Our mobile app brings the benefits of Amazon Connect to mobile devices, expanding its utility for diverse use cases,” he said.

### **Voice Biometrics: Beyond Security**

[**Paul MaGee**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-magee-a395b57/), CEO of Arraya, delivered a session on voice biometrics, exploring its potential beyond traditional security use cases. He discussed how advancements in cloud technology have made voice biometrics accessible to organisations of all sizes, enabling not just cost savings but also compliance with data privacy regulations.

“Voice biometrics isn’t just for banks or governments anymore,” Paul shared. “It’s for any organisation that handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and wants to offer secure, convenient service without compromising on data protection.”

A key takeaway was Paul’s perspective on multi-layered authentication: “There’s no silver bullet for strong authentication. Voice biometrics should complement other measures, like device identification, to balance security and convenience.”

### **The Evolution of Amazon Connect**

[**Pavan Dusanapudi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalipavan/), Lead Solutions Architect for Amazon Connect’s scheduling capabilities, shared insights from his work helping UK banks migrate thousands of agents to the platform. He highlighted the benefits of Amazon Connect’s integrated forecasting, scheduling, and capacity planning tools.

“Our customers wanted native, easy-to-use capabilities infused with AI and ML,” Pavan said. “The result is a platform that automates mundane tasks for contact centre managers, enabling greater efficiency and innovation.”

Pavan also reflected on the global adoption of Amazon Connect, noting that while smaller contact centres in the US often spearheaded its early use, large enterprises in the UK and Australia have embraced it for their most complex operations.

#### **Expanding the User Group**

The event closed with a look to the future. John Ing shared plans to expand the user group internationally, with potential sessions in the US and Australia. “The challenge is identifying where and how to break into these markets,” he explained. “We’ll likely start small, similar to our first UK event, and build from there.”

#### **Why This Matters**

For attendees, the event underscored the value of independent forums like this, where users can freely discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from one another. As Alex Baker put it, “It’s a safe space to talk - customers sharing with customers, partners, and AWS all in one room.”

Tom Morgan wraps up the podcast episode with a call to action: “If you’re thinking about attending the next one, don’t hesitate. The value lies in connecting with peers, exchanging ideas, and staying ahead in the ever-evolving world of contact centre technology.”
