#### **Are Your Contact Centre Calls Leading to Greater Customer Satisfaction?**

Consider the experience of a customer reaching out to a contact centre, anticipating expert guidance, only to leave the interaction feeling more uncertain than when they started. Such instances reveal a significant opportunity for improvement, highlighting the need for contact centres to equip agents with the right tools, training, and insights to offer a truly helpful and personalised service.

When customer service falters, it often reflects a broader issue in operational support and resource allocation. This is where Amazon Connect’s Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Dashboard, as enhanced by CloudInteract, offers a transformative approach. This tool not only captures customer feedback but provides actionable insights that empower managers to improve agent performance and elevate service quality.

#### **The Amazon Connect CSAT Dashboard: A New Standard in Customer Service**

Imagine a scenario where every customer interaction is meticulously analysed to continuously enhance the customer experience. The Amazon Connect CSAT Dashboard brings this vision to life, using real-time data to highlight opportunities for improvement. Here’s how the dashboard enables better service delivery:

*   **Real-Time Customer Feedback:** Aggregating CSAT scores from post-call surveys, the dashboard provides a clear view of customer satisfaction trends over time. This data helps managers detect and address issues before they escalate.
*   **Agent Performance Insights:** CSAT scores are broken down by individual agents, showcasing top performers and those needing additional support. Managers can pinpoint areas for development, ensuring that every agent has the tools they need to succeed.
*   **Queue Analysis:** By analysing CSAT scores across different service queues, the dashboard identifies areas where customers may be less satisfied. These insights can reveal underlying issues in specific departments or services.
*   **Survey Completion Rates:** The dashboard also tracks survey completion rates, highlighting potential drop-off points. This allows managers to improve survey engagement and better capture customer feedback.

#### **Exploring the Dashboard’s Key Features**

The Amazon Connect CSAT Dashboard offers a detailed visualisation of critical service metrics, designed by CloudInteract to empower organisations with actionable insights:

*   **Overall CSAT Score and Trends:** Managers can view the current CSAT score and its trend over time, allowing for swift identification of periods with rising or declining satisfaction.
*   **Survey Metrics:** Key statistics on surveys offered, started, and completed provide a clear picture of customer engagement and survey response trends.
*   **Agent-Specific Data:** The dashboard details each agent’s survey offers, starts, completions, and average scores for each question, helping managers assess individual agent strengths and areas for improvement.
*   **Queue Analysis:** By displaying survey metrics by queue, the dashboard pinpoints specific areas where service enhancements may be needed to improve customer experience.
*   **Question-Specific Feedback:** Scores for each survey question offer in-depth insights into particular service areas, guiding focused training and support.
