#### The Next Generation of Amazon Connect

Announced at Enterprise Connect 2025, the latest version of Amazon Connect is being dubbed the "next generation" – and for good reason. It brings together AI-powered capabilities across all channels, combined with a simplified all-you-can-eat pricing model.

Key highlights:

*   One pricing model for voice, chat, AI features (like Contact Lens), scheduling, and Amazon Q in Connect
    
*   Communication costs (e.g. telephony) still charged separately
    
*   Greater ease of adoption for AI tools across operations

#### New Analytics Features: Amazon Connect Analytics Data Lake

A major step forward for reporting and insights, the Amazon Connect Data Lake provides a unified source for contact records, agent metrics, Contact Lens data, and more. New table updates make it easier to deep-dive into performance across:

*   Lex bots
    
*   Outbound campaigns
    
*   Evaluation forms  
    API updates also support idempotency for more reliable data integration.

#### Agent Shift Bidding and Exchange

Now in FCS, agents can initiate shift trades with each other—without needing to take time off.  
Managers can choose which trades are auto-approved and which need manual sign-off, depending on customer segment or task criticality. A great step toward flexibility without losing control.

#### Dynamic Evaluation Forms

Say goodbye to form overload. Evaluation forms can now show or hide follow-up questions based on earlier responses. For example, if a customer made a purchase on a call, the form can automatically surface a question about sales disclosures.

#### Proficiency-Based Routing – More Updates

Previously, routing criteria could be updated only three times while a contact waited in queue. That limit’s gone. You can now update routing criteria as many times as needed—although only the last three are stored for metrics reporting.

#### Configure Amazon Q in Connect from the Admin Console

Admins can now set up AI agents, custom prompts, and content guardrails directly within the Amazon Connect admin site. This means less time jumping between tools, and more time getting the AI experience right.

#### Native Voicemail with IVR Recording

There’s now an AWS-provided GitHub solution for capturing voicemail _in the IVR leg_—something that previously required Kinesis Video Streams. It creates a task and routes it to an agent with the voicemail recording attached. Fewer moving parts = easier implementation.

#### Final Thoughts

From real-time AI agents to smarter analytics and pricing flexibility, the March 2025 updates mark a significant step in the evolution of Amazon Connect. These features bring new levels of intelligence, automation, and configurability to contact centres looking to transform customer experience.
