#### Welcome to our new series: Momentum: The change Journey! 

Change isn’t just about new technology or processes - it’s about people. Momentum: The Change Journey is a series dedicated to unlocking the power of effective change management, helping organisations move from resistance to readiness, and ensuring that transformation sticks. Through expert insights, practical strategies, and real-world stories, we’ll explore how to build adoption momentum and create lasting impact.

As someone who's been through the ups and downs of transformation, let me share a secret: it’s not just about rolling out something new. It’s about people and how they handle change. Without solid change management, your transformation efforts are likely to hit a brick wall. Here’s why change management needs a slice of that project pie if you expect to hit your goals.

## It's all about the people

So often when it comes to technology change, there's an assumption that everyone will adopt the new tools because, well, they have to. But it’s not that simple. People have ingrained ways of working, bureaucratic processes, and habits that can undermine the benefits you’re expecting to see. 

You may have control of your deadlines, budgets and business requirements. But what about the humans who are going to have to work in a new way? We need to focus on them too – and I promise you’re going to need more than a few emails and an instruction booklet. 

#### Executive Sponsorship: Beacons in Change

You’ll struggle to get your transformation off the ground without Executives onboard. A visible, engaged sponsor builds momentum and credibility, aligning the change with your company’s big picture goals. 

There’s a real difference in tone when you have a visibly engaged sponsor – even with the most challenging of transformations. And the credibility they build has long-term benefits – because with every successful change, your organisation is better primed for the next one. 

#### Meet Your Change Ambassadors

You can’t just talk to a few top folks and call it a day. You need to engage teams across the board and empower key people in each area to own the change.

These ambassadors are the change-makers in their teams. They spot those hidden processes and potential pitfalls that can delay or even derail a project and hurt the expected benefits. Plus, they’re always ready to give information, encouragement, and feedback to keep everything on track.

But these people don’t magically appear, already knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the change, and with plenty of capacity. 

I’ve seen change networks fail fastest and hardest when projects don’t spend enough time and effort on their training, nurturing and support. Yes, this takes resources and budget, but it’s crucial if you want to hit those benefit figures. 

#### Fear and Resistance: The Big Showstoppers  

Let’s face it, big change is scary. Especially when the change is outside of our control. And even the most innovative and forward-thinking people are going to be wondering:

*   Why do we need to change? (We’re busy enough as it is)
*   What does this really mean? (Is this just ‘code’ for cost-cutting and job losses?)
*   When will it all happen? (What deadlines will it clash with?)
*   How is it going to affect me? (What if it makes the job harder?)
*   Who’s going to help!? (I don’t know how to do this!)

Effective change management should address all these fears, helping minimise the risk of a project going off the tracks. 

#### Tailored Training: Embracing Change with Confidence

Even the most seasoned pros might feel a bit lost when they have to step into something new. Imagine going from being the expert everyone turns to, to suddenly having to learn new tricks. It's no wonder there's often some resistance.  
Don’t think that just sending out instructions via email is going to cut it either. Adopting new methods requires an ongoing effort. It all starts with hands-on, practical training that's tailored to the team. Workshops or sandbox environments where you can get your hands dirty can really turbo-charge learning and boost confidence quickly.  

It's important to see this as more than just a tick-box exercise. Sure, fitting in ample time for training within tight schedules is tough, and it does demand significant resources from both trainers and participants. But trust me, the long-term payoffs are worth it. Getting everyone prepped right from the start is crucial for lasting success.  

#### Making It Stick  

![CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon.png)Transformation isn't a one-off event; it's an ongoing journey! And you’re working with one hand trapped behind your back if you aren’t making the company culture and systems work for you. 

When you're aiming to shake up work practices, you need to keep an eye on current team behaviors to prevent slipping back into old habits. How can you keep track of these, and what could help reinforce new processes?

Leaders need to recognise that real change takes time and effort from everyone, not just the project team and stakeholders. Encouraging participation and celebrating success can be a game-changer in embedding the current change and making your organisation receptive for more. This doesn’t have to be formal, or even financial – there’s a social currency we see when people and teams are recognised at work. 

#### Wrapping It Up  

In short, you’ll fail to reach your transformation’s full potential without effective change management. Worse still, poorly managed change hits your bottom line because a disrupted, disengaged workforce is less productive.  
Address the human side of change - fear, resistance, and the need for support - to ensure successful adoption of new tools or processes. Executive sponsors provide the vision and inspiration, while change ambassadors bridge the gap between strategy and execution. Tailored training empowers employees, and a culture of continuous improvement builds resilience for future success.

Remember, at the heart of every transformation are people. Prioritise change management, and you’ll unlock the full potential of your transformation initiatives, driving meaningful and sustainable success.
