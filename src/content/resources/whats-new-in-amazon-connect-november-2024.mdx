# Amazon Connect: What's New - November 2024

As we head into the final stretch of the year, Amazon Connect continues to evolve, introducing new features and updates to enhance the way businesses interact with their customers. From streamlined user interfaces to powerful new capabilities for personalised engagement, here’s a round-up of the latest Amazon Connect updates that are making waves this November.

### A Refreshed User Interface

The AWS console has received a facelift with a sleek, more modern design. This isn't just a cosmetic change - it's about improving the overall user experience. The updated icons and interface make navigating through the platform easier, ensuring users can get to where they need to go faster and with fewer clicks.

### Expanding Language Support in Contact Lens

Since August, Amazon Connect has broadened its linguistic horizons. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are now supported in Contact Lens, enhancing transcription and post-call analysis. While real-time analysis for these languages is still a work in progress, this update is a significant step towards providing truly global customer service.

### Connect Dashboard Enhancements

In September, Amazon Connect introduced the **Send Message Contact Flow Block**, which is now available for both SMS and email. This feature allows for dynamic message types and templates, making it easier to manage customer communications. But that’s not all - this functionality can now also initiate outbound contact and escalate to live conversations with agents, opening up a whole new avenue for proactive customer engagement.

### SDK and Screen Sharing Capabilities

For those looking to integrate more deeply with AWS Connect, new **SDKs for iOS and Android** make native in-app chat a reality. Additionally, the long-requested **screen sharing** feature for web and video calls is now available, empowering agents to provide more interactive and visual support when needed.

### Forecasting and Capacity Planning via Data Lake Integration

Amazon Connect is taking forecasting and capacity planning to the next level with integration into the **data lake**. This enhancement makes it easier to access and analyse data, offering businesses valuable insights into their customer service operations. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with AWS praising the seamless integration of this data.

### Outbound Campaigns Get a Personal Touch

Outbound campaigns have undergone a major transformation. Now rebranded as **personalised and proactive engagement**, this feature has inherited functionalities previously found in Pinpoint, such as setting up audience segments. This means businesses can now create more targeted, engaging campaigns that are fine-tuned to meet customer expectations.

### Customisable Dashboards and Reports

The reporting experience in Amazon Connect just got a major upgrade. Customisable dashboards allow users to mix and match widgets, adjusting them to their needs for a more intuitive, visual reporting experience. With **threshold alerts** now available, users can set limits on key metrics (like queue answer times) to receive notifications when those thresholds are breached, ensuring teams can stay on top of performance.

### Amazon Q: Enhanced Knowledge and Personalisation for Agents

Amazon Q has also received a refresh. Now supporting website crawling as a knowledge source, this update makes it even easier for businesses to set up and maintain their knowledge base. The addition of **personalised guidance for agents** ensures that agents have the information they need when they need it, improving response accuracy and boosting customer satisfaction.

These updates reflect Amazon Connect’s ongoing commitment to making customer engagement more intuitive, efficient, and effective. By adding new languages, improving the user interface, and empowering businesses with more advanced features like screen sharing and outbound campaigns, Amazon Connect is continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in customer experience.

Whether you’re looking to streamline internal workflows, create more personalised customer journeys, or gain deeper insights into your contact centre’s performance, these new features are designed to help you deliver better, more responsive service.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate and support your customer experience journey with Amazon Connect!
