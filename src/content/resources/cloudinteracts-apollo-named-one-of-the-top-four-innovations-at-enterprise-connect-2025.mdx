# CloudInteract’s Apollo Named One of the ‘Top Four Innovations’ at Enterprise Connect 2025

Big news for **CloudInteract**: our newly launched AI-driven solution, **Apollo**, has been selected as one of only four technologies featured in the **Enterprise Connect 2025 Innovation Showcase**!

This recognition, highlighted in **[No Jitter’s recent announcement](https://www.nojitter.com/ai-automation/celebrating-innovation-one-character-at-a-time-at-ec25)**, is a major milestone for us - and a clear signal that **Apollo** is set to redefine the future of AI-powered customer experience.

#### What Makes Apollo Stand Out?

![Cloud Interact - Apollo Logo Full Colour](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo/Cloud%20Interact%20-%20Apollo%20Logo%20Full%20Colour.png)At a time when contact centres are overwhelmed by complexity - multiple customer touchpoints, fragmented data, and operational inefficiencies - **Apollo** cuts through the noise. Built on **Amazon Connect** and leveraging **Generative AI**, Apollo delivers:

*   **Real-time intelligence** for smarter decision-making
*   **Actionable insights** that improve agent efficiency
*   **Seamless integration** with existing workflows to enhance customer engagement

We designed **Apollo** with one goal in mind: to help businesses make **every contact count**. And now, with this industry recognition, we’re more excited than ever to showcase its impact at **Enterprise Connect 2025** in Orlando!

#### Why This Matters

The **[Enterprise Connect Innovation Showcase](https://enterpriseconnect.com/innovation-showcase)** is a **highly selective** programme that spotlights groundbreaking technology shaping the future of enterprise communications. Being chosen as **one of just four featured solutions** underscores **Apollo’s** ability to deliver real business value in an era where AI, automation, and data intelligence are transforming customer interactions.

We’ll be joining industry experts, analysts, and technology leaders at **Enterprise Connect** to demonstrate how Apollo helps businesses move from **insight to action** - and ultimately reimagine their contact centre strategy.
