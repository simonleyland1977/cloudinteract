We’re proud to share that CloudInteract is now an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, less than 4 months after launching.

Achieving Advanced status means that AWS recognises the advanced skills, technical expertise, and demonstrably improved experiences that CloudInteract is able to bring to our customers.

This status recognises that CloudInteract is deeply experienced in delivering modern customer experience solutions and has a team of deeply trained and certified consultants.
