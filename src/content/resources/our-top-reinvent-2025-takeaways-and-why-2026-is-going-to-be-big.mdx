**Our Top re:Invent 2025 Takeaways — and Why 2026 Is Going to Be Big**

Following an impactful week at re:Invent 2025, Nick Seagrave (CTO) and Alex Baker (Contact Centre Consultant & AWS Solution Architect) sat down to share the innovations they believe will shape CloudInteract’s roadmap — and redefine what’s possible for customer experience in 2026.

Across the announcements, one theme stood out: agentic AI is now real, production-ready, and scalable. For CloudInteract, AWS and our partners, this unlocks entirely new ways to design contact centres, self-service flows, and intelligent operations.

Below are the key developments Nick and Alex are keen to highlight:

1.  **Agentic Self-Service With Nova Sonic: The New Voice of Automation**

The leap in natural language capability this year was impossible to ignore — and Nova Sonic is front and centre.

The introduction of _agentic_ AI voice, able not just to talk but to reason, act, and modulate tone in real time, transforms what “IVR” even means. With Sonic’s expressive, human-like delivery, AI can now take on complex tasks that previously needed human agents.

**Why it matters for CloudInteract in 2026**

This aligns directly with several CloudInteract projects already underway. Nick and Alex see Sonic-powered self-service as a major accelerant for both greenfield and modernisation programmes:

*   Higher containment of complex calls
*   More empathetic, emotionally aware experiences
*   A chance to _design_ the next generation of IVRs, not just improve the old ones

2026 will see CloudInteract delivering fully agentic, hyper-natural voice experiences for the first time.

2.  **Multiple Knowledge Bases + Bedrock KB Integration: Finally, the Foundation We Needed**

 A long-standing limitation is now gone: AI agents can finally use multiple knowledge bases simultaneously — and tap directly into Bedrock Knowledge Bases without heavy lifting or duplicated content.

For Nick and Alex, this unlocks the missing backbone for scalable AI agent design.

**What this means for 2026**

*   Customers can use existing KBs “as is” (Confluence, SharePoint, AEM, etc.)
*   Clear separation of domain-specific knowledge — e.g., billing vs tech support
*   Cleaner governance and a more maintainable architecture
*   Faster implementation cycles on CloudInteract AI engagements

Expect CloudInteract to invest heavily in KB strategy, content pipelines, and architectural patterns that make AI reliable, explainable, and enterprise-ready.

3.  **AI-Powered Predictive Insights: A New Era of Agent Assist & Personalisation**

One of the most promising announcements for Alex was the evolution from Amazon Connect’s earlier “single-passage” recommendations into predictive, model-driven insights built on Customer Profiles.

This means real-time suggestions for next-best actions, churn risk, tailored product recommendations — all inside the contact centre workflow.

**Why this is exciting**

*   More relevant, personalised service
*   Better routing based on likelihood to buy or churn
*   A new frontier for agent assist, moving beyond lookup to true decision support
*   A bridge between CX teams and CRM/analytics functions

CloudInteract sees predictive insights as a core pillar of revenue-focused CX transformation in 2026.

4.  **MCP Support: The Architectural Breakthrough for Agentic AI**

For the architects in the room, this is huge: Model Context Protocol (MCP) now enables Connect AI agents to call standardised APIs, flows, and reusable tools — without brittle integration code.

Nick agrees MCP is the architectural backbone of future agentic projects.

**What CloudInteract will leverage in 2026**

*   Reusable MCP toolkits for order lookups, refunds, CRM actions, etc.
*   Faster, cleaner integrations across enterprise backends
*   Increased reliability and reduced maintenance cost
*   A consistent pattern library for every new AI agent CloudInteract builds

This is where CloudInteract expects to create significant IP and repeatable AWS-aligned assets.

5.  **Streaming Messages for AI: Small Detail, Big Experience Win**

While more subtle, the new streaming capability for AI chat — providing visible “typing” and partial responses — marks a key quality-of-experience upgrade.

For customers, it means lower perceived wait times and higher trust.

For CloudInteract, it's another piece of the puzzle in delivering premium, human-centred AI interactions.

**Looking Ahead to 2026**

 Across these innovations, Nick and Alex see a clear direction: 2026 is the year AI stops augmenting the contact centre and starts _owning_ meaningful parts of it.

With Sonic-powered conversational agents, unified knowledge frameworks, predictive intelligence, and a clean architectural foundation via MCP, CloudInteract is positioned to deliver:

*   Next-generation agentic IVRs
*   Domain-specialised AI assistants
*   Revenue-optimised service journeys
*   Deeply integrated, AWS-native enterprise experiences

CloudInteract is ready to co-build this future with AWS — and re:Invent 2025 has provided the perfect launchpad.

So let's start the conversation!
