Before CloudInteract: I thought CX was CX.

I was wrong.

Three years ago, I believed customer experience was a universal discipline. Best practices from retail? They'd work in healthcare. Strategies from tech companies? Just apply them to government.

Then I actually tried it.

I watched a "proven" retail chatbot completely fail in a hospital setting. The tone was wrong. The urgency thresholds were backwards. The assumption that faster = better? Actively harmful when a patient needs reassurance, not speed.

That was my aha moment.

The problem wasn't the technology. It was the assumption that a "customer" in a retail store has anything in common with a patient waiting for test results, or a citizen trying to access benefits, or a subscriber dealing with a service outage.

They don't.

Different emotional states. Different power dynamics. Different definitions of success. Different regulatory frameworks. Different consequences for getting it wrong.

So we built CloudInteract around a simple but radical idea:

Stop trying to make one-size-fits-all CX solutions. Start building vertical-specific experiences from the ground up.

Patient Experience for healthcare. Citizen Experience for government. Subscriber Experience for telecoms.

Same infrastructure. Different everything else.

Because your industry isn't just "different." Your industry has completely different rules about what good even means.

When did you realize your industry was fundamentally different from the others?
