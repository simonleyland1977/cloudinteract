## **Meet Caroline Edwards**

**![Caroline](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/People%20Pictures/Caroline.png)Meet Caroline Edwards, CloudInteract’s PMO extraordinaire -** juggling customer liaison, tech translation, and a boundless passion for time travel (no, really). Caroline thrives on diving headfirst into challenges, which explains why her first day was “in at the deep end” and why she’d make a wild horse in another life (free-spirited but also probably amazing at project deadlines). With a love of roasts, crème brûlée, and Spike Milligan-level wit, she’s the glue that keeps projects - and people - moving forward.

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### 2 Years - I was employee no. 1 (after Simon and Nick of course!!)

#### What was your first day like? 

##### In at the deep-end; just what I like!

#### What does working here mean to you? 

It gets me up in the mornings with a spring in my step, wondering what challenges lie ahead and knowing that all areas of the business are open to my questions, feedback and input. It’s the kind of hard work that I enjoy.  

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### My role involves client liaison at all stages of a project, from initial discovery to launch and follow-up. I work closely with the tech, comms and change teams, bringing the technology to life in layperson’s language so that everyone can understand and realise the benefits of their transformation.  

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### Working with people who bring out the best in me and in each other.  

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### There’s no such thing as a ‘typical day’ here! 

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### To travel through time. Relive memories and add colour and life to ancient places, see how people lived and worked. 

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### It’s a long list….. probably a really good roast with tons of vegetables and a big glass of wine, followed by raspberry crème brulee. 

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### A wild horse. Sure-footed, brave and free.
