## **Meet Sarah Smith**

**![Sarah Smith](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/People%20Pictures/Sarah%20Smith.jpg)Meet Sarah Smith, CloudInteract’s Business Intelligence Lead -** part data whisperer, part Captain Picard enthusiast, and a self-confessed sushi aficionado. Whether she’s turning numbers into visuals or channeling her inner leaf-cutting ant at the gym (strength goals, anyone?), Sarah’s all about collaboration and high standards. She’s also ready to teleport into action at a moment’s notice - probably to the nearest sushi bar or the future, where everything “impossible” becomes possible.

#### Favourite Quote: 

“Things are only impossible until they are not” Captain Picard

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### 5 months 

#### What was your first day like? 

##### I joined at the very start of a new project so we hit the ground running and started to plan the weeks / months ahead. We worked so cohesively and there was such strong expertise in the team – it was clear that our delivery would be of a high standard. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

Working in an agile, innovative, flexible, startup is thrilling. With an emphasis on collaboration and sharing knowledge, I am continuing to learn from all individuals within the Company. 

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### As a Lead Business Analyst, I work with the Customer / internal team to understand and communicate requirements. I enjoy working with data / the visual display of quantitative information so am often working with the Change Director to deliver visual outputs. 

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### Definitely the people. They’re the best in the biz. 

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### One of the things I like about working here is that there is no ‘typical day’. I could be required to work on a range of tasks in a single week; from meeting with the Customer, to reviewing a data set, to building a presentation for Senior Leadership. The one constant, however, is the speedy pace which makes it a very exciting place to work. 

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### Teleportation. 

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### Sushi. 

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### Maybe a leaf cutting ant, since I am currently strength training and would love to be able to lift 50x my body weight.
