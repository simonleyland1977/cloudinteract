As CXOs of global enterprises, you are always on the lookout for ways to improve productivity and efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance employee experience. With the rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly conversational AI, there is a new frontier that presents opportunities to achieve these goals. Enter OpenAI's ChatGPT, a powerful language model that can simulate human-like conversation and perform a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

### **So, what is OpenAI & ChatGPT?**

At its core, OpenAI is an AI research lab dedicated to advancing AI in a responsible and beneficial manner. ChatGPT is a result of their research and development efforts, which have been focused on creating AI that can understand and generate natural language. ChatGPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is a language model that is trained on an enormous corpus of text, enabling it to generate human-like responses to text inputs.

### **Let's look at some simple use cases of ChatGPT in employee apps**

*   Common HR enquiries can be answered by ChatGPT-powered chatbots, including those about payroll, benefits, and leave policies. These chatbots can be incorporated into a staff self-service site so that workers can get answers to their questions fast and easily.
*   Chatbots can also be utilised as an IT helpdesk to support employees in other ways. If an employee is having problems logging into the workplace VPN, for instance, they can talk to a bot powered by ChatGPT, which can diagnose the problem and walk them through fixing it.
*   ChatGPT's chat interface makes it easy for sales teams to request and receive critical sales documents like product sheets and case studies. As a result, sales representatives may have more time and energy to devote to making sales.

### **Considerations & Benefits of using ChatGPT in employee apps**

While the benefits of using ChatGPT in employee apps are numerous, there are some considerations that need to be taken into account. One of the most significant considerations is security. Conversational AI systems can potentially expose sensitive information, and it is important to ensure that access to these systems is limited to authorised individuals.

Another consideration is the quality of the data that is used to train the model. ChatGPT's performance is heavily dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data. As such, it is important to ensure that the data used to train the model is representative of the language used by employees in the organisation.

Despite these considerations, the benefits of using ChatGPT in employee apps are significant. By providing employees with fast and easy access to information, organisations can improve productivity and efficiency while reducing the workload on HR and IT teams. Chatbots powered by ChatGPT can also improve employee experience by providing a personalized and conversational interface for interacting with the company.

### **How to get started**

 So, how can you get started with using ChatGPT in employee apps? The first step is to develop a hypothesis of use. This involves identifying the business problem that you want to solve and the potential benefits that using ChatGPT can provide. Once you have developed your hypothesis, you can begin engineering these ideas into production.

To ensure the success of your ChatGPT implementation, it is important to work with a team that has experience in developing conversational AI systems, often achieve through upskilling. This team should be able to guide you through the process of developing a chatbot that is tailored to your organisation's specific needs and requirements.
