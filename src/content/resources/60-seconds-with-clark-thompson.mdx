## **Meet Clark Thompson**

**![Clark T 2](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/People%20Pictures/Clark%20T%202.jpg)Meet Clark Thompson, CloudInteract's resident Cloud Engineer -** master of AWS, cloud infrastructure, and a man who insists he only needs "a chicken burrito and an Arsenal Champions League win to achieve inner peace." Whether he’s debugging code or dreaming of life as a serene elephant (family vibes, not trunk-related tech support), Clark’s combination of skill, humor, and sheer burrito enthusiasm makes him a team favorite.

#### Favourite Quote: 

“Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.” George Bernard Shaw

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### 1 Year 

#### What was your first day like? 

##### My first day was wonderful, I was queried about where I saw myself in the future and how the company can help to make me reach that point. This was followed by pointing out the right people to talk to, in order to enhance my skillset and reach my goals. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

Working at CloudInteract has changed my outlook on the corporate world. The company has allowed me to develop into a vital team member whilst feeling like my work is important to completing each project. The work I do also keeps pushing me toward my goal of being a successful DevOps engineer in the future, making it a pleasure to come to work every day. 

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### As a Cloud Engineer, my job is to help clients solve problems using Cloud Technology such as AWS. My day to day can vary a lot, but tasks include testing infrastructure, writing infrastructure as code & helping to optimise contact centres using Amazon Connect 

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### The learning. When joining CloudInteract, it was important to me that I’d have the chance to get hands on and complete some tasks using my existing knowledge so that I could push further. Since being at CloudInteract I have been able to work with several technologies to take me to another level in my career, my personal favourite being Cloud Formation, which enabled me to be able to push on and complete the AWS Solutions Architect Pro Exam. 

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### For myself there isn’t so much a typical day! I’m lucky enough to work with a number of different skilled people throughout the day, I could be creating routing profiles or pushing deployments through environments. Overall, the one constant would be testing our products and highlighting & supporting the fixing of bugs. 

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### Seeing into the future! This is a power that would let me live in normality whilst being able to benefit from picking the lottery numbers, and seeing how long I’ll have to wait to watch Arsenal win the Champions League without having to fight the bad guys! 

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### In general, I love a chicken burrito but the best thing I’ve ever eaten was a New York Strip steak from Hell’s Kitchen in Las Vegas! 

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### An Elephant. They’re such peaceful creatures that tend to stay with their families whilst enjoying beautiful environments, sounds like a perfect life for me!
