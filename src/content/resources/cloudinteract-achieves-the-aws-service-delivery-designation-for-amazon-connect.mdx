CloudInteract is delighted to share this news:

**We have achieved the AWS Service Delivery designation for Amazon Connect, and are now an SDP Certified Partner!!**

The AWS Service Delivery Program is designed to validate AWS Partners that have deep technical knowledge, experience, and proven success in delivering specific AWS Services (Amazon Connect) to customers.

For a young company like ours, this is fantastic recognition of the strength of expertise within our business, the amazing clients we are working with, and the innovative and unique solutions we have developed.

We received wonderful feedback during the assessment from AWS; "Your technical competence was great", "Business knowledge was impressive", and "You brought best practice to us that we had not requested".

Not bad for a 10 week old organisation......
