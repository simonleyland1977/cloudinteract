**CloudInteract, UK – 6 January 2025** — CloudInteract is proud to unveil **Apollo**, a groundbreaking data intelligence solution designed to redefine how organisations approach customer service. With a unique blend of AI-driven insights, automation, and seamless integration, Apollo delivers unparalleled clarity and actionable data to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction - regardless of the platform a business is using.

Apollo is more than just another tool in the contact centre technology space. It’s a game-changer. By leveraging advanced AI to automatically categorise calls, assess sentiment, and integrate voice biometric authentication, Apollo provides organisations with the ability to predict and respond to customer needs in real time, improving service outcomes and driving down operational costs.

## The Apollo Advantage: Transforming Customer Interactions with Intelligence

What sets Apollo apart from the competition is its ability to offer valuable insights that have never been available before. Using data from your existing voice and chat platforms, Apollo analyses and categorises customer enquiries, providing in-depth understanding of the types of issues customers are facing, how long it takes to resolve them, and the sentiment behind every interaction.

##### Key insights include:

*   **Automated Call Categorisation**: Apollo uses sophisticated algorithms to categorise calls based on content, enabling faster and more accurate responses to customer needs. In fact, **companies using automated call categorisation have seen a 30% reduction in average handle time**.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding customer emotions in real-time allows businesses to adapt service strategies and enhance satisfaction. **84% of customers say the experience a company provides is as important as its products or services**, making sentiment analysis a critical tool for modern customer service.
*   **Voice Biometric Authentication**: Apollo accelerates the identification process, reducing the time spent on manual verification. **Studies show that voice authentication can cut verification time by up to 40%**, allowing agents to focus on resolving customer issues.
*   **Data-Driven Insights and Reporting**: Providing actionable analytics on call metrics, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction, Apollo empowers businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions. **Data-driven companies are five times more likely to make faster decisions** and experience **8% higher revenue** than their competitors.

Unlike traditional customer service solutions, Apollo doesn’t just collect data - it actively empowers businesses to implement changes that lead to long-term improvements. With Apollo, organisations can automate tasks, optimise call flows, and reduce reliance on human agents while maintaining the highest levels of customer service.

#### **New Insights, New Opportunities: The Future of Customer Service is Here**

“We believe Apollo is a leap forward for businesses looking to enhance their customer service operations,” says Simon Leyland, CEO and co-founder of CloudInteract. “We’ve developed a solution that not only automates but also analyses customer interactions in ways that were previously impossible. Apollo equips organisations to address customer service challenges proactively - whether it’s improving efficiency, reducing costs, or enhancing customer satisfaction.”

What’s more, Apollo’s implementation process is designed to be smooth and scalable. Organisations can begin by implementing simple automation tasks and gradually progress to more sophisticated AI-driven functions as they experience the benefits firsthand. Apollo’s flexible design also means that it works with any existing customer service platform, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes and industries.

#### **A Solution for Today’s Evolving IT and Customer Service Landscape**

As businesses continue to face increasing pressure to do more with less, Apollo provides the ultimate solution: operational efficiency and better service outcomes, without compromise. By reducing costs associated with manual processes, improving call resolution times, and driving better customer engagement, Apollo is poised to revolutionise the way companies think about their contact centre operations.

With the demand for smarter, faster customer service on the rise, Apollo is the tool businesses need to stay ahead of the curve. It’s not just about handling customer enquiries - it’s about using the power of AI to anticipate and exceed customer expectations, creating a new era of customer service.

#### **Stats to Back the Impact**:

*   **Cost Savings**: Apollo can help businesses **reduce operational costs by up to 30%** through automation and smarter resource allocation.
