## **Meet Muhammad Younis**

**![Muhammad](https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/People%20Pictures/Muhammad.jpg)Meet Muhammad, CloudInteract’s Platform Engineer -** the man who turns ideas into code while dreaming of lamb chops karahi and time-traveling superpowers. With a knack for tackling new challenges and a day that loops between meetings, coding, and contemplating a gym routine (work in progress), Muhammad thrives on innovation. He’s already built a Teams integration app for Amazon Connect, proving he’s as sharp-eyed and strategic as the eagle he’d like to be—flying high, observing everything, and striking only when it matters.

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### I joined CloudInteract on 17th June 2024.

#### What was your first day like? 

##### First day was an exciting confusing mix things. There was a lot in mind like which products I will work on and how’s the environment but after taking a few meetings, I must admit, I feel it is a nice company environment and culture. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

Every day, I am enjoying it. It feels like I am not doing a job but developing myself. Tom is very nice, I like the vibes and ideas we discuss in every meeting, so it gives me a drive to perform well and do things from my heart.

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### I am mainly involved in development rather than specifically working on Amazon Connect. For now I have developed a product with Tom that works as a third party app within Amazon Connect that helps agents to communicate with colleagues on MS Teams. 

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### Working on new things instead of repeating things is the best part. Every day a new requirements comes up, new challenges which always keep you excited.  

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### Currently it’s like a loop of Eat, Sleep, Meetings and Coding. Trying to start some physical activities but still trying ☹  

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### Control on Time, reverse time and do again what I failed to do perfectly. 

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### Lamb chops karahi 😊  

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### I prefer to be an Eagle: fearless, fly high and  observe everything but respond only when required.
