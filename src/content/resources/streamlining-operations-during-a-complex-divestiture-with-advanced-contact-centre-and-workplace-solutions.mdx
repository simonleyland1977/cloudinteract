### The road to transformation is rarely smooth, and sometimes, it requires a serious level of collaboration and determination

Our customer, a global leader in clinical research, was faced with an immense challenge following its recent divestiture from its parent company. Under a hard deadline of December 2024, the organisation needed to transition its IT services from  the former parent company to independent systems.

The scope of the task was significant - particularly with their large contact centre and modern workplace environments.

The existing infrastructure relied on outdated systems, including a legacy on-premise contact centre platform, which slowed productivity and created operational inefficiencies. With limited internal resources and an impending deadline, our customer was under pressure to quickly implement a new, scalable solution while minimising disruption to ongoing operations. The stakes were high, as failure to meet the deadline would result in costly penalties.
