#### 1\. Real-Time Agent Activity Monitoring

Stay on top of your team's performance with the new real-time agent activity widget in the Queue and Agent Performance dashboard. This feature allows managers to monitor agents in real time, take action like listening in or changing agent states, and set configurable thresholds with colour coding for quick insights.

#### 2\. Customisable Dashboards for Enhanced Visualisation

Dashboards now offer more flexibility. You can define widget-level filters, reorder columns, and create unique visualisations such as combining queued contacts, average wait times, and abandonment rates into a single chart.

#### 3\. Email Contact Evaluations

With email channels gaining traction, managers can now evaluate agent performance on email interactions. The enhancements include public API support for incorporating third-party data, enabling a comprehensive review process.

#### 4\. Free Trials for Contact Lens

First-time users can try Contact Lens for free, including 100,000 voice minutes per month for the first two months, and a 30-day trial for performance evaluations. This is a great opportunity to explore conversational analytics.

#### 5\. Voice-to-Voice Translation

AWS introduced a voice-to-voice (V2V) translation sample project. While not production-ready, it offers exciting possibilities for live translation during calls, simulating natural conversation flows with minimal silence.
