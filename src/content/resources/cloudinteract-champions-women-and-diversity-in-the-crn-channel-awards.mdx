At CloudInteract, we believe that real progress is made when diverse perspectives come together to tackle the toughest challenges in technology and customer experience. That’s why we’re proud to share that _six_ of our exceptional team members have been nominated in this year’s [**CRN Women & Diversity in Channel Awards**](https://event.channelweb.co.uk/womenanddiversityinchannelawards/en/page/2025-individual-longlist) - a record number of nominations for us and a powerful reflection of the values we live every day.

For a growing company in a traditionally male-dominated industry, it shows that our commitment to inclusive hiring, empowering leadership, and championing the right people for the right roles is making a measurable difference. 

The CRN Women & Diversity in Channel Awards, relaunched in 2022, aim to celebrate not only the achievements of women in the channel but also to shine a light on broader diversity and inclusion across the tech ecosystem. From engineers and analysts to directors and marketers, the awards honour those breaking boundaries and driving positive change. 

We’re thrilled to introduce our brilliant nominees: 

*   **Eliza Taylor**, Change Director 
*   **Karen Leyland**, Chief Operating Officer 
*   **Louise Mahrra**, Marketing Director 
*   **Charlotte Laundy**, Contact Centre Platform Engineer 
*   **Sarah Smith**, Business Analyst 
*   **Caroline Edwards**, PMO Analyst 
*   **Zoe Harman**, Operations Director 

Each of these individuals brings something unique to CloudInteract - but what unites them is their determination to reimagine customer experience and push boundaries, not just for our clients, but for the industry as a whole. 

> “When we established CloudInteract we wanted to create an environment where people look forward to working together and have a chance to do their best work.  We’ve hired on capability and character and established a world class team in our industry. These nominations aren’t just about the individuals (though they are outstanding); they reflect the kind of business we are building—one where everyone’s voice matters.”   
> – _Simon Leyland, Co-Founder and CEO, CloudInteract_ 

  
As a business, we’re actively working to accelerate change - not just within our own walls, but across the industry. These awards are a reminder of how far we’ve come, and how far we’re willing to go to ensure diverse voices are not only heard, but empowered to lead. 

Congratulations to all our nominees - you are the change-makers, the innovators, and the heart of CloudInteract.
