This month’s Amazon Connect updates include a mix of quality-of-life improvements and new capabilities that help contact centre teams better manage operations, reporting, and integrations.

#### **Key highlights:**

🔹 **Bulk Agent Schedule Removal**  
You can now remove schedules for up to 400 agents in one go or up to 30 days for an individual agent — ideal for public holidays or offboarding scenarios.

🔹 **Real-Time Adherence & Dashboards**  
Live agent adherence views are now available directly in the performance dashboard, with filters, conditional formatting, and sorting options to keep operations on track.

🔹 **Outbound Campaign Insights**  
Campaign reporting just got smarter — five new metrics and dashboard drill-downs now offer visibility into engagement, execution, and delivery issues.

🔹 **DescribeContact API Enhancements**  
Developers can now access disconnect reasons, recording statuses, ACW time, and custom attributes in a single API call, helping automate re-queuing and more.

🔹 **Email Quotas Updates**  
Expanded limits on email domains (up to 100 per instance) and clarification on attachment and expiry settings help clarify configuration for high-volume environments.

🔹 **Agent Hold Tracking**  
A new contact record field enables tracking of agent-initiated holds during multiparty calls — delivering insights into who’s keeping callers waiting.

🔹 **Voice Transfer & Region Expansions**  
External voice transfer is now available in five additional regions, including London — great news for customers moving off legacy systems.

🔹 **Voice Cherry Picking Prototype**  
Built by AWS SA Ryan Headland, this GitHub project showcases how agents can see and select live calls from their queue via a third-party app within Connect.

🔹 **End of Voice ID Support**  
Heads-up: Amazon Connect Voice ID will no longer be supported after May 20, 2026.

🔹 **Plus:** Enhancements for GovCloud dashboards, WhatsApp support in more regions, agent schedule access controls, and improved analytics via the agent hierarchy group table.
