## **Meet Tom Morgan**

**Meet Tom Morgan, CloudInteract’s Platform Architect -** a tech wizard, sardine connoisseur, and part-time cat negotiator (yes, really). When he’s not architecting solutions or herding metaphorical cats, Tom’s busy chasing sunsets in Greece or marveling at his fearless 15-year-old feline’s street smarts. Whether it’s delivering the “impossible” for customers or just surviving another day without a vet visit, Tom’s blend of creativity, grit, and humor keeps things interesting.

#### Favourite Quote: 

“If you can dream it, you can do it.” Walt Disney

#### How long have you worked for CloudInteract? 

##### Since January 2023. 

#### What was your first day like? 

##### I’d already been speaking to Nick & Simon, so I sort of knew what I would be doing. It was a day of catching up, finding my feet, and planning for how to deliver on our commitments for the next 6 months. 

#### What does working here mean to you? 

I love the ability to really make a difference in a company, so being a cog in a huge corporate machine isn’t for me. CloudInteract feels like a family of like-minded smart individuals all working together to create amazing outcomes using the best technology we can get our hands on, and making that technology really work for our customers. 

#### How would you describe what you do? 

##### Finding solutions to problems, translating customer requirements into outcomes, architecting robust and scalable code, firefighting, cat herding, and helping to showcase and promote the individual and collective efforts of our world-class engineering team. 

#### What's the best part of your job? 

##### Watching customer reactions when we demo them something that someone else has told them can’t be done. 

#### Describe a typical day... 

##### Get up early, run, gym, take my daughter to school, coffee during first meeting, focus on some code, maybe write some documents or have some more meetings, get outside for lunch, more code, more meetings, help with dinner & bedtime, work on personal projects, sleep.  

### The Fun Part 

#### If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 

##### To be able to say no to things without feeling bad. 

#### What's your favourite food? 

##### That’s a tough one. I think food is shaped completely by place and atmosphere. Sardines are fine, but fresh caught sardines BBQ’d for you in a beach restaurant in Greece, sitting watching the sun go down with your feet in the sand, enjoying a drink with your partner: they’ll taste like some of the best sardines you’ll ever eat. 

#### If you could be an animal, what would you be and why? 

##### I think a cat. Specifically, my cat, who seems to sleep 23 hours a day but can still climb a tree or catch a mouse at the elderly age of 15, when he wants to. He’s tiny but faced down a ginger Tom twice his size the other day. I had to break them up, and I thought the Tom was going to go for me, he was massive. No cares in the world, my cat. I think he probably would have won if I’d left him, but I didn’t fancy another trip to the vets to remove another infected claw from his head.
