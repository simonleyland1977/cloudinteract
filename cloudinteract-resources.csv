<!--more--><p>In 2026.</p>
<p>Here's what happened:</p>
<p><strong>Minute 1-5:</strong> Automated system asks me to say what I need. I say ""technical support."" It doesn't understand. I try again. ""Technical support."" Still nothing. I press 0. It says ""I didn't understand that.""</p>
<p><strong>Minute 6-12:</strong> Finally get the menu. Press 3 for technical support. It asks for my account number. I enter it. It asks for my postcode. I enter it. It asks for my phone number. I enter it. It says ""I couldn't verify your information."" I've been a customer for 8 years.</p>
<p><strong>Minute 13-20:</strong> Start over. This time it works. On hold. The music stops every 30 seconds with ""Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold."" If my call was important, someone would answer it.</p>
<p><strong>Minute 21-35:</strong> Still holding. I've now heard the same 45-second music loop 20 times. I contemplate my life choices. I wonder if I should just live without internet. Decide that's not realistic. Keep holding.</p>
<p><strong>Minute 36-42:</strong> A human! Finally! I explain my issue: internet keeps dropping every 2 hours. They say ""Let me transfer you to our technical team."" I explain I've been holding for 40 minutes already. They say ""Don't worry, it'll just be a moment.""</p>
<p>I get transferred.</p>
<p>The call drops.</p>
<p><strong>Minute 43-47:</strong> Call back. Start over. Same automated system. Same account verification. Same hold music. Finally get through to someone different. Explain everything again. They schedule an engineer visit. For next Thursday. Between 8am and 6pm.</p>
<p>That's a 10-hour window.</p>
<p>This is why we built CloudInteract.</p>
<p>Not because contact centres lack technology. They don't. Most have plenty of it.</p>
<p>But because most contact centre experiences are built for the business, not the person calling.</p>
<p>Think about what I just went through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asked me to verify my identity 3 times in one call</li>
<li>Couldn't remember my issue between transfers</li>
<li>No option to schedule a callback (so I didn't waste 47 minutes)</li>
<li>No proactive notification about the outage (they knew—hundreds of customers were calling)</li>
<li>Engineer visit window that assumes I have nothing better to do</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single one of these issues is solvable with today's technology.</p>
<p>Every. Single. One.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: It's not just about adding AI or automation. It's about designing the experience from the customer's perspective, not the org chart's.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we call this vertical CX. Because a telecom customer dealing with an internet outage has completely different needs than:</p>
<ul>
<li>A patient calling about test results</li>
<li>A citizen trying to access benefits</li>
<li>A subscriber managing their service</li>
</ul>
<p>Different stakes. Different urgency. Different expectations.</p>
<p>Generic contact centre solutions treat all these the same. They don't understand context. They don't understand that being on hold for 47 minutes about an internet outage is fundamentally different than waiting for a retail refund.</p>
<p>So we build vertical-specific solutions on AWS that actually understand the industry, the person, and the problem.</p>
<p>Not just better technology. Better experiences.</p>
<p>Because in 2026, no one should spend 47 minutes on hold only to have the call drop.</p>
<p>What's your worst recent contact centre experience? I know I'm not alone in this.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Aileron"":[""Black"",""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Extra Bold"",""Extra Bold Italic"",""Extra Light"",""Extra Light Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic"",""Thin"",""Thin Italic""]}) }}","","","DRAFT","false"

<!--more--><p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I believed customer experience was a universal discipline. Best practices from retail? They'd work in healthcare. Strategies from tech companies? Just apply them to government.</p>
<p>Then I actually tried it.</p>
<p>I watched a ""proven"" retail chatbot completely fail in a hospital setting. The tone was wrong. The urgency thresholds were backwards. The assumption that faster = better? Actively harmful when a patient needs reassurance, not speed.</p>
<p>That was my aha moment.</p>
<p>The problem wasn't the technology. It was the assumption that a ""customer"" in a retail store has anything in common with a patient waiting for test results, or a citizen trying to access benefits, or a subscriber dealing with a service outage.</p>
<p>They don't.</p>
<p>Different emotional states. Different power dynamics. Different definitions of success. Different regulatory frameworks. Different consequences for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>So we built CloudInteract around a simple but radical idea:</p>
<p>Stop trying to make one-size-fits-all CX solutions. Start building vertical-specific experiences from the ground up.</p>
<p>Patient Experience for healthcare. Citizen Experience for government. Subscriber Experience for telecoms.</p>
<p>Same infrastructure. Different everything else.</p>

<p>Following an impactful week at re:Invent 2025, Nick Seagrave (CTO) and Alex Baker (Contact Centre Consultant &amp; AWS Solution Architect) sat down to share the innovations they believe will shape CloudInteract’s roadmap — and redefine what’s possible for customer experience in 2026.</p>
<p>Across the announcements, one theme stood out: agentic AI is now real, production-ready, and scalable. For CloudInteract, AWS and our partners, this unlocks entirely new ways to design contact centres, self-service flows, and intelligent operations.</p>
<p>Below are the key developments Nick and Alex are keen to highlight:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Agentic Self-Service With Nova Sonic: The New Voice of Automation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The leap in natural language capability this year was impossible to ignore — and Nova Sonic is front and centre.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The introduction of <em>agentic</em> AI voice, able not just to talk but to reason, act, and modulate tone in real time, transforms what “IVR” even means. With Sonic’s expressive, human-like delivery, AI can now take on complex tasks that previously needed human agents.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Why it matters for CloudInteract in 2026</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">This aligns directly with several CloudInteract projects already underway. Nick and Alex see Sonic-powered self-service as a major accelerant for both greenfield and modernisation programmes:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Higher containment of complex calls</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>More empathetic, emotionally aware experiences</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>A chance to <em>design</em> the next generation of IVRs, not just improve the old ones</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">2026 will see CloudInteract delivering fully agentic, hyper-natural voice experiences for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong> Multiple Knowledge Bases + Bedrock KB Integration: Finally, the Foundation We Needed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">A long-standing limitation is now </span><span style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">gone: AI agents can finally use multiple knowledge bases simultaneously — and tap directly into Bedrock Knowledge Bases without heavy lifting or duplicated content.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">For Nick and Alex, this unlocks the missing backbone for scalable AI agent design.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>What this means for 2026</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Customers can use existing KBs “as is” (Confluence, SharePoint, AEM, etc.)</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Clear separation of domain-specific knowledge — e.g., billing vs tech support</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Cleaner governance and a more maintainable architecture</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Faster implementation cycles on CloudInteract AI engagements</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Expect CloudInteract to invest heavily in KB strategy, content pipelines, and architectural patterns that make AI reliable, explainable, and enterprise-ready.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong> AI-Powered Predictive Insights: A New Era of Agent Assist &amp; Personalisation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most promising announcements for Alex was the evolution from Amazon Connect’s earlier “single-passage” recommendations into predictive, model-driven insights built on Customer Profiles.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">This means real-time suggestions for next-best actions, churn risk, tailored product recommendations — all inside the contact centre workflow.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Why this is exciting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>More relevant, personalised service</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Better routing based on likelihood to buy or churn</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>A new frontier for agent assist, moving beyond lookup to true decision support</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>A bridge between CX teams and CRM/analytics functions</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">CloudInteract sees predictive insights as a core pillar of revenue-focused CX transformation in 2026.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong> MCP Support: The Architectural Breakthrough for Agentic AI</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">For the architects in the room, this is huge: Model Context Protocol (MCP) now enables Conne</span><span style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">ct AI agents to call standardised APIs, flows, and reusable tools — without brittle integration code.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Nick agrees MCP is the architectural backbone of future agentic projects.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>What CloudInteract will leverage in 2026</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Reusable MCP toolkits for order lookups, refunds, CRM actions, etc.</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Faster, cleaner integrations across enterprise backends</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>Increased reliability and reduced maintenance cost</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>A consistent pattern library for every new AI agent CloudInteract builds</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">This is where CloudInteract expects to create significant IP and repeatable AWS-aligned assets.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong> Streaming Messages for AI: Small Detail, Big Experience Win</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While more subtle, the new streaming capability for AI chat — providing visible “typing” and partial responses — marks a key quality-of-experience upgrade.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">For customers, it means lower perceived wait times and higher trust.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"">For CloudInteract, it's another piece of the puzzle in delivering premium, human-centred AI interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead to 2026</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Across these innovations, Nick and Alex see a clear direction: 2026 is the year AI stops augmenting the contact centre and starts <em>owning</em> meaningful parts of it.</p>
<p>With Sonic-powered conversational agents, unified knowledge frameworks, predictive intelligence, and a clean architectural foundation via MCP, CloudInteract is positioned to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Next-generation agentic IVRs</li>
<li>Domain-specialised AI assistants</li>
<li>Revenue-optimised service journeys</li>
<li>Deeply integrated, AWS-native enterprise experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>CloudInteract is ready to co-build this future with AWS — and re:Invent 2025 has provided the perfect launchpad.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The rise of <em>Agentic AI </em>is the new frontier in CX and the potential behind it is impossible to ignore. Agentic AI sees the shift from simple reactive processes to proactive actions meaning multi task/complex problems are now open to be solved by AI. We’re on the brink of a technological shift where hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google will host intelligent ‘<em>agents’</em> in the cloud, functioning much like digital employees. These ‘agents’ will handle everyday operational tasks with autonomy, consistency, and speed – which for contact centres means radically increasing the effective capacity and streamlining the experience for customers.</p>
<p>While there has been some recent negative stories about virtual agents going rogue and companies reverting back to using human agents, agentic AI can be a transformative tool if set up properly and utilised where it’s are best suited. There is no doubt that practical use cases are already here and healthcare is a prime candidate for revolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Real-World Problem: Prescription Management</strong></p>
<p>Managing repeat prescriptions should be a straightforward task, yet countless patients will tell you it’s anything but. From endless call queues to delays, miscommunication, and inefficiencies, it’s clear that the system is overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Now imagine deploying a '<em>Prescription Agent'</em> - an AI-driven digital employee whose sole task is to manage prescription workflows: checking requests, confirming dosages, communicating with patients, and coordinating with pharmacies. It works 24/7, doesn’t get fatigued and scales instantly.</p>
<p>You’ve just increased your surgery’s capacity without increasing headcount.</p>
<p>Now multiply this across any healthcare provider, and you’ve scaled the effective workforce dramatically—without hiring a single additional person. The same logic can apply to appointment booking, test result delivery and multiple other tasks. With intelligent, task-focussed AI agents, it is possible to realistically increase the system’s effective capacity at a fraction of the cost of the current inefficient process and with a far greater ability to scale and adapt. It’s not science fiction; it’s practical, scalable, and ready now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Healthcare to Customer Experience: The Same Playbook Applies</strong></p>
<p>This same principle also applies to contact centres in other industries. Don’t think of AI as a cost-saving tool, although it is, think of it as a capability multiplier.</p>
<p>The real message isn’t ""Cut costs with AI."" It’s “Would you like to triple or quadruple your customer support capacity?” And those seeking cost savings will reap the benefits anyway.</p>
<p>Agentic AI isn’t just the next tech trend. It’s a new workforce model. One where the ceiling for capacity, consistency, and responsiveness is fundamentally redefined. But it requires intelligent application and you need to avoid the common pitfalls.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that nuance is everything. There will undoubtedly still be a need for humans to deal with more complex queries and ones where customers still want human interaction. So with that said how can you set up for success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small</strong>: Pilot, assess, refine, and scale gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Segment your interactions</strong>: Identify what’s simple, complicated, and truly complex. AI should handle the first two, not the third.</li>
<li><strong>Apply consistent quality checks</strong>: Hold your AI agents to the same standards as your human ones.</li>
<li><strong>Use sentiment analysis</strong>: Detect frustration early and escalate to a human when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid repetition</strong>: AI should cut loops, not create them. Escalate quickly when it’s stuck.</li>
<li><strong>Control your AI’s knowledge base</strong>: Don’t rely entirely on large language models—define boundaries and use structured prompts relevant to your business and customer needs</li>
<li><strong>Fix bad processes first</strong>: Automating a broken workflow won’t make it better. Rethink before you replicate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where We’re Headed</strong></p>
<p>We’re on the cusp of an abundance era, not where we replace people, but where we <strong>remove the bottlenecks</strong> that are holding them back. Agentic AI offers a chance to dramatically increase organisational capability in a way that’s flexible, scalable and built for the realities of modern service delivery.</p>
<p>At <strong>CloudInteract</strong>, we bring together deep contact centre experience and advanced AI capability. We’re already deploying agentic AI where it makes the biggest impact; empowering intelligent agents with the data, context, and guardrails they need to deliver real outcomes.</p>

<!--more--><p><em>Simon Leyland, CEO CloudInteract</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s be honest — most large organisations know their contact centre setup is a bit of a mess. You don’t need Apollo to tell you that your customer experience feels about as modern as a fax machine. Yet customers today expect faster, frictionless, human-like experiences — and they expect them yesterday. But for too many businesses, those expectations keep crashing into the same wall: legacy technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contact centre that once served as a dependable workhorse has become more of an anchor. It’s increasingly out of sync with how customers actually live, shop, and communicate. And as AI continues to evolve at breakneck speed, the gap between what’s possible and what legacy systems can deliver widens by the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question isn’t <em>“Should we modernise?”</em> — it’s <em>“How fast can we do it without breaking everything in the process?”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s where smart migration comes in: a strategic, insight-led, low-risk route to the future of AI-driven CX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Legacy Limitation: Why Standing Still Isn’t Safe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many enterprises have poured millions into on-prem or hybrid systems from the usual suspects — you know the ones. Over the years, those platforms have grown into sprawling webs of integrations, custom scripts, and manual workarounds that make change feel like open-heart surgery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<ul>
<li>Disparate systems — voice over here, chat over there, and not a single unified view in sight.</li>
<li>Limited insight — too much data, too little intelligence.</li>
<li>High cost to serve — because apparently, printing money isn’t an option.</li>
<li>Snail-paced innovation — every new AI project comes with a six-month business case and a packet of paracetamol.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this market, standing still isn’t neutral — it’s going backwards and quickly. Every day you spend maintaining the old is a day someone else spends building the new.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smart Migration: Not Ripping and Replacing — Rethinking and Re-Energising</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Now, I’m not suggesting we all rip the cables out of the server room and move it to the cloud. Smart migration is about <em>moving with intent</em> — using data and automation to guide each step so you can modernise without mayhem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we’ve helped some of the biggest brands in the world do exactly that. As an AWS Advanced Partner and Amazon Connect specialist, we combine deep CX know-how, cloud engineering muscle, and a healthy obsession with outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our secret weapon is <a href=""/apollo-making-every-contact-count"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Apollo</strong></a>, our data-intelligence platform that provides answers to key questions. Together, this approach rests on three simple truths:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarity before change — understand your operation before you change it.</li>
<li>Confidence through insight — build a business case based on real data, not gut feel.</li>
<li>Acceleration through automation — get value from day one, not year three.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Clarity Before Change: Seeing What the Legacy Systems Hide</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’d be amazed how many vast contact centres are run with no real visibility into what’s actually happening day to day. Average call handle time may be known, but not how many of those calls could have been automated, or where the friction points are killing customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why every smart migration starts with insight. Apollo plugs into your existing stack — whatever you’ve got — and, within a short few weeks, surfaces:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Which interactions are repetitive or ripe for automation.</li>
<li>Where your workflows are leaking time and money.</li>
<li>Which agents are excelling and who needs coaching.</li>
<li>And how all that translates into pounds, pence, dollars and cents - and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one of our global clients, Apollo showed that 60% of inbound calls were simple, repetitive tasks. We automated them. Result: a 79% reduction in queue time and a drop of 80% in talk time. The agents were happier, the customers were happier, and the CFO… well, you can imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the power of clarity — it turns hunches into hard evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong> Confidence Through Insight: Building the Case That Gets Signed Off</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s face it — no one ever got promoted for pitching an expensive migration project without a watertight business case. Migration isn’t just a technical job; it’s a commercial one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why we built a Migration Business Case Framework, powered by Apollo. It helps you quantify exactly where your inefficiencies lie, model the potential savings, and map out your lowest-risk path forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One client, running a 1,000-agent operation, used Apollo’s data to migrate to Amazon Connect in just four months. They now save half a million dollars a year. When the numbers speak for themselves, approvals come faster — and finance stops glaring at you in the corridor.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding-left: 36pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson? There is potential risk involved in change, but the more you can prepare the lower the risk and the increased chance of success for the migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong> Acceleration Through Automation: Where the Magic Happens</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve made the leap, things get interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Amazon Connect at the core and CloudInteract’s solutions layered on top, our customers start to experience the true value of AI-driven CX:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>AI-powered self-service for the repetitive stuff.</li>
<li>Agentic AI that gives live guidance to your (human) agents mid-call.</li>
<li>Elastic scalability, so busy periods don’t break the system.</li>
<li>Unified data and analytics across every business app you rely on.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As organisations move from <em>Migrated</em> to <em>Integrating</em> to <em>Accelerating</em>, the compounding effect of automation becomes clear. Lower costs. Happier teams. Better conversations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Amazon Connect?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because, frankly, it’s built for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon Connect isn’t another monolithic contact centre platform. It’s cloud-native, serverless, and backed by the scale and reliability of AWS. It plays well with your existing tools — Salesforce, Pega, UKG, you name it — and gives you immediate access to AWS latest services based on Agentic AI such as Lex and Contact Lens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the pay-as-you-go model means you’re only charged for what you use. For once, a tech bill that actually makes sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Migration to Momentum</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going live isn’t the finish line — it’s the start of the fun part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we don’t just hand over the keys and disappear. We stay close — side by side with our customers — helping them navigate the business change that inevitably comes with new technology. Because let’s face it, the tech is the easy bit; it’s the people, processes, and mindset shifts that really decide whether transformation sticks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our business change support is something clients often tell us is <em>invaluable</em>. We roll up our sleeves, embed with your teams, and make sure the new ways of working actually work — so you keep squeezing more value from your investment, month after month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One multinational saved $120K a year by deploying Apollo Quality Management, using the savings to fund their AI roadmap. Another is trialling Nova Sonic, our AI agent that handles simple calls on its own — proof that when business change is managed properly, innovation doesn’t stall after go-live; it accelerates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the CloudInteract difference: we don’t just migrate you — we move with you. Migration opens the door — continuous improvement keeps it open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Human Side of All This</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, I’m not one of those CEOs who thinks AI will replace people. Far from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart migration is about giving humans better tools so they can do more meaningful work. It’s about agents who spend less time cutting and pasting customer details across three screens, and more time actually helping people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When repetitive calls go to automation, your human agents get to be, well, more human. Customers feel it. And your service metrics prove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>De-Risking Change: The Safe Way to Move Fast</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest blocker to migration isn’t technology — it’s fear. Fear of cost, disruption, or the unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But here’s the irony: staying put is far riskier. Legacy platforms are getting more expensive to maintain, support skills are dwindling, and your competitors are sprinting ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why we designed our Proof of Value (POV) and Business Case programmes — short, 4- to 8-week projects that prove the impact before you commit. You see the data, the savings, the automation potential — all before you migrate a single agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, change doesn’t feel like a gamble. It feels like common sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Legacy to Limitless</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The era of AI-driven CX isn’t coming — it’s already here. Your customers are interacting with brands that respond instantly, predict their needs, and solve problems before they even arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re still running on legacy systems, the gap between you and them grows every day. But here’s the good news: it’s entirely bridgeable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With CloudInteract and AWS, you can migrate with clarity, integrate intelligently, and accelerate with confidence. You’ll move from constraint to capability, from firefighting to foresight — from legacy to limitless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Thought</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart migration isn’t just a tech exercise; it’s a mindset. It’s about turning insight into action, data into direction, and AI into everyday advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, before you leap, get the clarity you need. Plug in Apollo, see what’s really going on in your contact centre, and let’s build your business case for change — together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you’re still not sure… well, get in touch with us for a chat. We’ll show you how simple “smart” can really be.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The rise of <em>Agentic AI </em>is the new frontier in CX and the potential behind it is impossible to ignore. Agentic AI sees the shift from simple reactive processes to proactive actions meaning multi task/complex problems are now open to be solved by AI. We’re on the brink of a technological shift where hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google will host intelligent ‘<em>agents’</em> in the cloud, functioning much like digital employees. These ‘agents’ will handle everyday operational tasks with autonomy, consistency, and speed – which for contact centres means radically increasing the effective capacity and streamlining the experience for customers.</p>
<p>While there has been some recent negative stories about virtual agents going rogue and companies reverting back to using human agents, agentic AI can be a transformative tool if set up properly and utilised where it’s are best suited. There is no doubt that practical use cases are already here and healthcare is a prime candidate for revolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Real-World Problem: Prescription Management</strong></p>
<p>Take GP surgeries. Managing repeat prescriptions should be a straightforward task, yet countless patients across the UK will tell you it’s anything but. From endless call queues to delays, miscommunication, and inefficiencies, it’s clear that the system is overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Now imagine deploying a '<em>Prescription Agent'</em> - an AI-driven digital employee whose sole task is to manage prescription workflows: checking requests, confirming dosages, communicating with patients, and coordinating with pharmacies. It works 24/7, doesn’t get fatigued and scales instantly.</p>
<p>You’ve just increased your surgery’s capacity without increasing headcount.</p>
<p>Now multiply this across the NHS, and you’ve scaled the effective workforce dramatically—without hiring a single additional person. The same logic can apply to appointment booking, test result delivery and multiple other tasks. With intelligent, task-focussed AI agents, it is possible to realistically increase the system’s effective capacity at a fraction of the cost of the current inefficient process and with a far greater ability to scale and adapt. It’s not science fiction; it’s practical, scalable, and ready now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Healthcare to Customer Experience: The Same Playbook Applies</strong></p>
<p>This same principle also applies to contact centres in other industries. Don’t think of AI as a cost-saving tool, although it is, think of it as a capability multiplier.</p>
<p>The real message isn’t ""Cut costs with AI."" It’s “Would you like to triple or quadruple your customer support capacity?” And those seeking cost savings will reap the benefits anyway.</p>
<p>Agentic AI isn’t just the next tech trend. It’s a new workforce model. One where the ceiling for capacity, consistency, and responsiveness is fundamentally redefined. But it requires intelligent application and you need to avoid the common pitfalls.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that nuance is everything. There will undoubtedly still be a need for humans to deal with more complex queries and ones where customers still want human interaction. So with that said how can you set up for success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small</strong>: Pilot, assess, refine, and scale gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Segment your interactions</strong>: Identify what’s simple, complicated, and truly complex. AI should handle the first two, not the third.</li>
<li><strong>Apply consistent quality checks</strong>: Hold your AI agents to the same standards as your human ones.</li>
<li><strong>Use sentiment analysis</strong>: Detect frustration early and escalate to a human when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid repetition</strong>: AI should cut loops, not create them. Escalate quickly when it’s stuck.</li>
<li><strong>Control your AI’s knowledge base</strong>: Don’t rely entirely on large language models—define boundaries and use structured prompts relevant to your business and customer needs</li>
<li><strong>Fix bad processes first</strong>: Automating a broken workflow won’t make it better. Rethink before you replicate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where We’re Headed</strong></p>
<p>We’re on the cusp of an abundance era, not where we replace people, but where we <strong>remove the bottlenecks</strong> that are holding them back. Agentic AI offers a chance to dramatically increase organisational capability in a way that’s flexible, scalable and built for the realities of modern service delivery.</p>
<p>At <strong>CloudInteract</strong>, we bring together deep contact centre experience and advanced AI capability. We’re already deploying agentic AI where it makes the biggest impact; empowering intelligent agents with the data, context, and guardrails they need to deliver real outcomes.</p>

This isn’t just a shift; it’s a complete reimagining of how we collaborate, communicate, and create value together. Welcome to the future of<br>work, where adaptability isn’t just a strategy; it’s a survival skill.</p>
<p>In our latest white paper, <em>Adapt, Empower, Thrive: The New Era of Work and Technology,</em> we explore the key shifts reshaping workplaces today. From building cultures of trust to leveraging technologies like Generative AI to amplify - not replace - human ingenuity, it’s clear that adaptability isn’t just a strategy; it’s survival.</p>
<p>💡 Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why productivity is no longer about hours at a desk but outcomes delivered.</li>
<li>How AI tools like Microsoft Copilot are empowering teams to focus on creativity and strategy rather than repetitive tasks.</li>
<li>The importance of fostering trust, flexibility, and belonging in this new era of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t just about trends; it’s about actionable insights to help organisations thrive in a future defined by change.&nbsp;</p>

Expectations are high, margins are tight, and transformation is no longer optional. At CloudInteract, we’ve seen these pressures play out time and again: spiralling costs, agent churn, inconsistent service, and rising demand for automation.</p>
<!--more--><p>But it doesn’t have to stay that way.</p>
<p>With the right technology stack — <strong>Amazon Connect</strong>, <strong>Unlimited AI</strong>, and <strong>Apollo</strong> — and a structured maturity framework, you can redesign your contact centre to overcome these challenges and set a foundation for long-term, scalable success.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the seven biggest pain points and how modern, AI-powered contact centres are solving them - one stage at a time.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">1. Constant Cost Pressure</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Reduced%20cost%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Reduced cost icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Most contact centres are still treated as cost centres, not value drivers. That means cost-cutting is often the default response to performance pressure. But slashing budgets only gets you so far.</p>
<p><strong>AI-driven automation</strong> is a smarter alternative. With solutions like <strong>Amazon Lex for self-service</strong>, and real-time assistance through <strong>Amazon Q in Connect</strong>, you can automate routine interactions, deflect low-value contacts, and let agents focus on what really matters — complex, high-impact queries.</p>
<p>The result? Lower operational costs without compromising service quality — and a step closer to becoming a strategic asset to the business.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">2. High Churn &amp; Inefficient Recruitment</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/AI%20bot%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""AI bot icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Recruiting and retaining contact centre agents is getting harder. The learning curve is steep. The work is repetitive. The burnout is real.</p>
<p>That’s where AI can step in. Tools like Apollo accelerate onboarding with guided workflows and real-time support, reducing ramp-up time significantly. <strong>Predictive analytics</strong> can also flag churn risk early, helping leaders take proactive steps to retain talent.</p>
<p>When your agents feel supported and less overwhelmed, they stick around longer — and deliver better service.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">3. Inconsistent Quality</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Enhanced%20Phone%20icon.png"" width=""241"" height=""241"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Enhanced Phone icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 241px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Maintaining consistent, high-quality service at scale is nearly impossible without automation. Manual QA processes only scratch the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Lens for Amazon Connect</strong> changes that — delivering 100% QA coverage, real-time sentiment analysis, and automated scoring. Combine that with <strong>Apollo’s intelligent feedback loops</strong>, and you get a constant stream of insight to drive agent coaching, spot performance trends, and raise the quality bar across every channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">4. Lack of Real-Time Insight</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Positive%20trending%20data%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Positive trending data icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">If you can’t see what’s happening across your customer interactions, how can you improve?</p>
<p>Legacy platforms make this hard. But when your contact centre is built on <strong>Next Gen Amazon Connect</strong>, data becomes accessible, visible, and actionable. Apollo gives you dashboards that surface exactly what’s happening — across agent performance, customer sentiment, and automation effectiveness — all in real time.</p>
<p>This level of visibility enables better, faster decisions and drives continuous improvement across operations.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">5. Pressure to Automate — Without the Strategy</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Journey%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Journey icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Everyone wants AI. But not everyone is ready for it.</p>
<p>Too many businesses jump into automation without a strategy. That’s why we use our <strong>CX Maturity Journey Framework</strong> — a four-stage roadmap that helps you build the right capabilities, at the right time.</p>
<p>You start simple (e.g. automating FAQs), then layer in AI for agent assist, and scale toward predictive intelligence — all at a pace that’s sustainable and measurable. It’s not about jumping on a trend. It’s about building a foundation that lasts.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">6. IT Bottlenecks and Delays</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Time%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Time icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">We’ve all heard it: “It’ll be at least six months before IT can get to it.”</p>
<p>That’s why <strong>Amazon Connect’s cloud-native model</strong> is so powerful. It empowers CX and ops leaders to make changes fast — without being at the mercy of long IT lead times. Apollo takes this even further, enabling drag-and-drop automation, pre-built integrations, and AI modules that can be deployed in weeks, not quarters.</p>
<p>This is what modern agility looks like: no code, no waiting, just action.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">7. Customer Frustration</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Person%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Person icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">If the previous six challenges sound familiar, chances are your customers are already feeling the impact.</p>
<p>Slow responses. Repetitive questions. Being passed from bot to agent with no context. All of this erodes trust.</p>
<p>But with a smart, AI-powered platform built on <strong>Amazon Connect</strong>, you can flip that experience on its head. Imagine customers being routed to the right resource first time, being understood by intelligent bots, and receiving truly personalised experiences at scale.</p>
<p>This isn’t a vision. It’s achievable. Today.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px; text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The Power of the CX Maturity Journey Framework</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CX-and-Journey-Diagram.png"" width=""565"" height=""398"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CX-and-Journey-Diagram"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 565px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"">Addressing these challenges takes more than technology — it takes a strategy. Our <strong>CX Maturity Journey Framework</strong> helps you progress in four clear stages:</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #f40876;""><strong style=""font-size: 22px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"">Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h4>
<p>Establish a cloud-native contact centre with Amazon Connect. Implement core automation for basic tasks like password resets, balance checks, and FAQs.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></h4>
<p>Add agent-facing AI tools like real-time assistance, better onboarding workflows, and insights dashboards. Begin using analytics to shape service delivery.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></h4>
<p>Scale AI across the customer journey. Deploy natural language bots, self-service flows, and performance analytics to reduce cost and increase resilience.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Exploring the Art of the Possible</strong></h4>
<p>Now you’re ready to innovate. Use Apollo to deploy predictive analytics, next-best-action engines, and deep personalisation based on real-time behavioural data.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Final Thoughts</span></h4>

<p>This month’s Amazon Connect updates include a mix of quality-of-life improvements and new capabilities that help contact centre teams better manage operations, reporting, and integrations.</p>
<h4><strong>Key highlights:</strong></h4>
<p>🔹 <strong>Bulk Agent Schedule Removal</strong><br>You can now remove schedules for up to 400 agents in one go or up to 30 days for an individual agent — ideal for public holidays or offboarding scenarios.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Real-Time Adherence &amp; Dashboards</strong><br>Live agent adherence views are now available directly in the performance dashboard, with filters, conditional formatting, and sorting options to keep operations on track.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Outbound Campaign Insights</strong><br>Campaign reporting just got smarter — five new metrics and dashboard drill-downs now offer visibility into engagement, execution, and delivery issues.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>DescribeContact API Enhancements</strong><br>Developers can now access disconnect reasons, recording statuses, ACW time, and custom attributes in a single API call, helping automate re-queuing and more.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Email Quotas Updates</strong><br>Expanded limits on email domains (up to 100 per instance) and clarification on attachment and expiry settings help clarify configuration for high-volume environments.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Agent Hold Tracking</strong><br>A new contact record field enables tracking of agent-initiated holds during multiparty calls — delivering insights into who’s keeping callers waiting.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Voice Transfer &amp; Region Expansions</strong><br>External voice transfer is now available in five additional regions, including London — great news for customers moving off legacy systems.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Voice Cherry Picking Prototype</strong><br>Built by AWS SA Ryan Headland, this GitHub project showcases how agents can see and select live calls from their queue via a third-party app within Connect.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>End of Voice ID Support</strong><br>Heads-up: Amazon Connect Voice ID will no longer be supported after May 20, 2026.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Plus:</strong> Enhancements for GovCloud dashboards, WhatsApp support in more regions, agent schedule access controls, and improved analytics via the agent hierarchy group table.</p>

<h4>Key Features Demonstrated</h4>
<p><span style=""color: #7d55c7; font-size: 20px;"">1. Native Teams Chat within Amazon Connect</span><br>Agents can now send messages to colleagues directly within the Amazon Connect interface using Microsoft Teams. Whether it’s a quick 1:1 message or a group chat, this feature helps agents collaborate without switching platforms.<br><br><span style=""color: #7d55c7; font-size: 20px;"">2. Seamless Call Transfer to Microsoft Teams Users</span><br>Need to bring in a subject matter expert mid-call? No problem.

Real-Time Agent and Team Status Visibility</span><br>Visibility into team availability is crucial in high-volume contact centres. The integration provides live status updates for agents and teams, helping everyone stay aligned and know who’s available at a glance.<br><br><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #7d55c7;"">4. What’s Coming Next: Agent Presence Synchronisation</span><br>Muhammad also gives a sneak peek into upcoming functionality: full presence synchronisation. Soon, agents’ status updates in Amazon Connect will reflect in Microsoft Teams—and vice versa—ensuring alignment across both platforms.</p>
<h4>Why This Matters</h4>
<p>Contact centres are evolving fast, and so are customer expectations. Integrations like this one help break down communication silos, empower frontline agents, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.<br><br>Whether you're managing a customer service team, overseeing IT infrastructure, or driving digital transformation across your organisation, this kind of unified communications solution can dramatically improve operational efficiency.</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h5><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">By Nick Seagrave – CTO, CloudInteract | Series: Cutting Through the Hype</span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Let’s start with this:</h4>
<p>Most of what’s said about AI in customer service is either a glossy sales pitch or a poorly disguised product push. You don’t need more hype. You need clarity.</p>
<p>So here it is.</p>
<p>If you're running a contact centre operation today and you’re not applying AI to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, you’re wasting time, budget, and likely burning out your teams.</p>
<p>This isn’t a “someday” initiative. It’s an immediate opportunity. And if you're already using Amazon Connect, you’re sitting on a tech stack that’s more powerful than most people realise — especially when you start plugging AI in properly.</p>
<h4>What's the Problem?</h4>
<p>Let’s talk realities.</p>
<p>In most contact centres I walk into, I still see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents spending 3+ minutes looking for answers in a static knowledge base</li>
<li>QA teams manually listening to random call samples for compliance</li>
<li>Operations struggling to forecast or adapt to peaks</li>
<li>Customers repeating themselves across IVR, chat and voice</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is necessary anymore. Not if you’re serious about modernising.</p>
<h4>What Does AI Actually Fix?</h4>
<p>Forget the buzzwords. Here’s what AI actually does when deployed properly in Amazon Connect:</p>
<h5 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">1. Reduces Repeat Work</span></h5>
<p>Conversational bots using Amazon Lex handle your top 10 inbound queries before an agent is even involved. Password resets, appointment bookings, order status — off the plate, 24/7.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>Lower volumes, faster response times, and happier customers.</p>
<h5 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">2. Gives Agents Real-Time Context</span></h5>
<p>With Amazon Q in Connect, agents get suggested answers and next steps live during the call. No more tab-switching between five tools or guessing what the customer wants.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>Shorter handle times, less training overhead, fewer errors.</p>
<h5 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">3. Improves Visibility Without Adding Overhead</span></h5>
<p>Contact Lens transcribes and analyses every interaction automatically. You get sentiment scores, keyword trends, compliance alerts — no more guessing, no more random sampling.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>You focus your coaching, fix issues faster, and prove performance without spreadsheets.</p>
<h4>The Tech Isn’t the Problem — Adoption Is</h4>
<p>Now, before anyone throws AI at the wall and calls it innovation, here’s the warning: tech only works when it’s designed for the people using it.</p>
<p>I’ve seen GenAI rolled out to agent desktops like it’s some magic pill. And then it fails because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t align with their workflows</li>
<li>It’s not trained on the right knowledge</li>
<li>It’s introduced without context or coaching</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re serious about scaling customer experience with AI, it’s not just about switching on the tools. It’s about designing the data flows, the feedback loops, and the experience layer that makes it work.</p>
<h4>AI vs. Traditional CX — The Cold Hard Facts</h4>
<p>Here’s the real comparison I show most CTOs and CIOs:</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/table%20graphic%20for%20Nicks%20blog%20on%20ai-powered%20contact%20centre.jpg"" width=""960"" height=""436"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""table graphic for Nicks blog on ai-powered contact centre"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 960px;""></p>
<p>This isn’t theoretical. We’ve delivered these kinds of outcomes with customers who were initially hesitant but committed to doing it right.</p>
<h4>You Don’t Need to Rip and Replace — You Need to Rethink</h4>
<p>If you're already on Amazon Connect, you have the foundation. The missing piece is how you’re using the data, the AI, and the automation that’s already available to you.</p>
<p>This is what I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with your most repetitive queries. Automate them first. Quick ROI, fast proof.</li>
<li>Give agents smart tools. Don’t replace them—equip them. Let AI reduce their admin, not their value.</li>
<li>Focus on outcomes, not interfaces. Every feature you enable should link directly to a measurable business goal.</li>
<li>Track performance. Use data to course-correct quickly. No long implementation cycles. No guesswork.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final Thought: It's Time to Get Practical</h4>
<p>AI in the contact centre isn’t shiny tech anymore. It’s just good operations.</p>
<p>If your peers are scaling customer experience without inflating costs, it’s because they’ve figured out how to use the tools. You can too.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for a 12-month roadmap. Start with a 30-day proof of concept.</p>
<p>See what works. Scrap what doesn’t. And build smarter from there.</p>
<p>👇 Let’s Talk <img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/lets%20talk%20no%20background.png"" width=""250"" height=""250"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""lets talk no background"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;""></p>

<p>Complexity is often the enemy of progress. Disconnected systems, underutilised data, and surface-level automation can result in an experience that feels fragmented for customers, and frustrating for agents.</p>
<!--more--><p>At CloudInteract, we believe in reimagining customer experience by focusing on what really matters: people. And to deliver something truly better — more meaningful, more intelligent, and more connected — you need more than just technology. You need an integrated approach grounded in<span style=""color: #7d55c7;""> <strong>three essential pillars</strong>: <strong>AI, Data, and Communication</strong></span>.</p>
<p>These pillars aren’t trends. They’re the foundation of a modern contact centre that works for everyone: your customers, your agents, and your business.</p>
<h4><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Data%2c%20AI%2c%20Communications%20altogether.png"" width=""546"" height=""546"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data, AI, Communications altogether"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 546px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"">Why These Three Pillars?</h4>
<p>The promise of customer experience transformation is often sold through big, bold claims. But the organisations seeing meaningful, measurable change are those who take a more grounded approach — aligning AI, data, and communication into a cohesive framework.</p>
<p>Each pillar on its own has value. But the real power lies in how they work <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>together</strong></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>AI</strong> </span>empowers people with intelligent support and automation.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Data</strong> </span>provides the insight that drives continuous improvement.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Communication</strong> </span>ensures those interactions are clear, consistent, and human.</li>
</ul>
<p>At CloudInteract, these pillars aren’t just part of our solution design; they’re built into the very DNA of <strong>Apollo</strong>, our data accelerator developed on the back of real customer need. Apollo exists to make every contact count.</p>
<h4>AI – Improving Performance through Intelligence</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Ai%20icon.png"" width=""277"" height=""277"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Ai icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 277px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">AI has moved from buzzword to business-critical; but only when it’s used with purpose. In the contact centre, its role is not to replace people, but to support them. We see the best results when AI is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded directly into agent workflows (not bolted on)</li>
<li>Providing real-time guidance, automated summarisation, and policy prompts</li>
<li>Supporting quality assurance and compliance without manual burden</li>
</ul>
<p>Apollo connects into these flows by surfacing the right information at the right time. It empowers agents to focus on high-value conversations, while AI quietly handles the rest — summarising calls, flagging trends, and enhancing decision-making.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>AI doesn’t solve everything — but it should make everything smoother.</strong></span></p>
<h4>Data – Driving Continuous Improvement</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Data%20icon.png"" width=""247"" height=""247"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 247px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Every interaction generates data. But few organisations are set up to use that data in the moment it matters most.</p>
<p>Our approach to data is grounded in real-world operational needs. It’s about creating a unified data architecture, not adding another analytics tool. Apollo supports this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing together structured and unstructured data into one live environment</li>
<li>Enabling real-time insight across regions, teams, and channels</li>
<li>Powering predictive analytics and proactive service interventions</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, we don’t see data as just a reporting function. It’s a living, breathing part of your CX operation — the foundation for smarter decision-making at every level.</p>
<h4>Communication – Enhancing Every Interaction</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Communication%20icon.png"" width=""278"" height=""278"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Communication icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 278px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Even with the best tools and data, if your communication isn’t working, your customer experience will fall short. Communication is more than the channel — it’s the <em>quality</em> of every interaction.</p>
<p>That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving agents the confidence and clarity to engage with customers effectively</li>
<li>Aligning tone, timing, and message across platforms</li>
<li>Ensuring self-service tools don’t just deflect volume, but deliver real value</li>
</ul>
<p>Through <a href=""/apollo-making-every-contact-count"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apollo</a>, we help surface key customer context in real time so agents can communicate with empathy, relevance, and speed. We also help ensure your contact centre is not only connected to customers, but also to the wider business, creating a seamless loop of information that supports better outcomes.</p>
<h4>Building for What Comes Next</h4>
<p>Customer expectations will continue to evolve. Technology will keep changing. What remains constant is the need for a better experience — for everyone involved.</p>
<p>By anchoring your <a href=""https://www.cloudinteract.io/cx-maturity-journey"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">CX strategy </a>around AI, Data, and Communication — not as standalone tools, but as interconnected enablers — you can future-proof your operations while delivering real value today.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we don’t just believe in better, <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>we build it</strong></span>. Together, let’s reimagine what your contact centre could be when every interaction is intelligent, informed, and impactful.</p>

<p data-start=""238"" data-end=""615"">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">AWS Named a Leader in Forrester Wave for CCaaS</span></h2>
<p>Amazon Connect has been recognised as a Leader in the latest Forrester Wave for Contact Centre as a Service (CCaaS). The platform achieved top scores in areas such as AI architecture, generative AI support, pricing flexibility, and innovation. It also received above-average ratings in customer feedback, underlining its growing impact in real-world contact centre environments.<br>👉 <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/forresterwave2025/"">Read more on the AWS blog</a></p>
<h2>Mass Notifications Now Supported for Outbound Campaigns</h2>
<p>Amazon Connect now enables event-driven outbound campaigns designed for mass notifications. This supports use cases such as severe weather alerts or public safety messages. To use this feature, AWS requires pre-authorisation via a support ticket to ensure appropriate and responsible use.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/enable-outbound-campaigns.html"">Learn how to enable outbound campaigns</a></p>
<h2>New Calendar View for Agent Adherence&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Supervisors can now view agent schedule adherence in a calendar format, offering a more intuitive way to monitor performance. The new interface allows you to spot and filter adherence breaches by agent, date, and duration, with up to 90 days of history. This provides a clearer picture of team trends and enables more informed management decisions.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/scheduling-view-schedule-supervisors.html#scheduling-display-adherence-data"">More on scheduling and adherence</a></p>
<h2>Contact Lens Expands Language Support</h2>
<p>Amazon Connect Contact Lens now supports an additional 34 languages, including Arabic, Cantonese, Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Vietnamese, and more. This expanded coverage allows organisations to apply analytics and insights across a wider customer base. Support levels may vary by feature, so it’s recommended to check compatibility by language.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/supported-languages.html#supported-languages-contact-lens"">See the full list of supported languages</a></p>
<h2>Configurable Wait Times for IVR Input&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A new update allows you to customise the wait time between DTMF inputs in IVR menus. The interval can now be adjusted between 1 and 20 seconds (previously fixed at 5 seconds), offering greater flexibility in designing customer input flows.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/store-customer-input.html"">Read more about IVR configuration</a></p>
<h2>Greater Control Over Sentiment Analysis in Contact Lens&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Organisations can now enable or disable sentiment analysis independently within Contact Lens. This means you can continue to use other analytics features while turning off sentiment scoring, providing more nuanced control over how customer interactions are assessed.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/enable-analytics.html#disable-sentiment-analysis-voice-and-chat"">Customise sentiment analysis settings</a></p>
<h2>SLA Tracking Now Available for Amazon Connect Cases&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A significant addition to Amazon Connect Cases is the ability to set and monitor service level agreements (SLAs). Admins can define SLA rules based on case attributes, establish resolution targets, and set up escalation rules. Agents and supervisors can view SLA status in real time, helping teams prioritise effectively and meet customer expectations.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/cases-sla.html"">Get started with SLA tracking</a></p>
<h2>Improved Access Control for Reporting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Reporting access can now be limited by agent hierarchy, allowing managers to see only the data relevant to their teams. This granular access control supports better governance, particularly in larger or multi-team environments, and complements existing tagging-based controls for agents, queues, and routing profiles.<br>👉 <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/dashboard-access-control.html"">Learn how to configure access control</a></p>
<h2>Amazon Bedrock Prompt Optimisation and Caching Now Generally Available&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Two enhancements from Amazon Bedrock are now generally available: prompt optimisation and prompt caching. Prompt optimisation rewrites user inputs for improved inference results, while caching reduces latency and input token costs. These capabilities further enhance performance and efficiency in generative AI workloads.<br>👉 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlD2i6gT9Js"">Watch the explainer video</a></p>
<h4>Looking Ahead&nbsp;</h4>
<p>These updates represent Amazon Connect’s continued commitment to intelligent, agile, and user-driven contact centre innovation.

But for many technology leaders, the term raises more questions than it answers.</p>
<!--more--><p>What does “next generation” really mean in the context of a contact centre? What tangible differences should you expect to see - and how do you know whether your organisation is on the right track?</p>
<p>In this blog, we aim to move beyond the jargon and focus on the practical foundations and forward-looking capabilities that define a truly modern contact centre - and how Apollo, our data accelerator built on Amazon Connect, helps organisations bring that vision to life.</p>
<h4>Moving Beyond Technology for Technology’s Sake</h4>
<p>Too often, transformation efforts focus on the technology itself - implementing AI, migrating to cloud platforms, or adopting new channel tools - without stepping back to assess how these changes impact customer experience, agent productivity, or operational performance.</p>
<p>While cloud-native platforms like Amazon Connect, machine learning models, and real-time analytics are all critical components, it is the integration and orchestration of these elements that truly define a next generation contact centre.</p>
<h4>Defining the Next Generation Contact Centre</h4>
<p>A next generation contact centre should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Data-led</strong>: </span>It brings together customer and operational data from across the business in real time, enabling more personalised and efficient interactions. Leaders have the visibility they need to spot trends, identify gaps, and make confident decisions.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>AI-augmented</strong>:</span> Artificial Intelligence is used not as a gimmick, but as a core enabler - streamlining workflows, improving self-service, supporting agents in live conversations, and enhancing compliance through real-time guidance and quality checks.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Human-centred</strong>:</span> While automation plays a key role, human experience - for both customers and frontline teams - remains central. The goal is to reduce complexity, remove friction, and empower people with the right information at the right moment.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Composable by design</strong>: </span>Legacy systems often lock organisations into rigid workflows. In contrast, modern contact centres are modular, flexible, and designed to evolve - enabling faster experimentation, scaling, and integration with wider business systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What That Looks Like in Practice</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/APPROVED%20-%20A%20Winning%20Formular%20-%20Pearson%20infographic-1.png"" width=""569"" height=""320"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""APPROVED - A Winning Formular - Pearson infographic-1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 569px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">We recently supported a global education provider with a complex customer service operation spanning multiple geographies and systems. As the organisation grew and expanded its digital offering, the contact centre began to experience the pressure of scale - with legacy tools struggling to keep up with rising expectations and fragmented data across teams.</p>
<p>{{cta('194158518459','justifycenter')}}</p>
<p>Agents had limited visibility of the full customer journey. Supervisors couldn’t get a clear view of performance trends or pain points in real time. And technology teams were spending more time stitching systems together than delivering innovation.</p>
<p>Our team transformed their Amazon Connect environment into a fully integrated, data-intelligent contact centre. By consolidating data sources and embedding real-time insights directly into the agent and supervisor experience, the organisation could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve response times and resolution rates through better context and automation</li>
<li>Unlock real-time performance insights for operational leaders</li>
<li>Reduce complexity across the technology stack, freeing up internal teams to focus on strategic priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was a significant shift from reactive operations to proactive experience management - with data, AI, and communication working in harmony.</p>
<h4>The Role of Apollo in Enabling What’s Next</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo%20named%20in%20top%20four%20innovations-2.png"" width=""523"" height=""294"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Apollo named in top four innovations-2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 523px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Apollo was developed to bridge the gap between potential and performance. It enables organisations to unlock the full value of Amazon Connect and GenAI by simplifying data integration, enhancing real-time visibility, and surfacing insights where they matter most - at the point of contact.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Faster time to value</strong></span> when modernising legacy platforms</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Greater agility</strong></span> in responding to customer needs and business priorities</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Improved decision-making</strong></span> through accessible, actionable intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where to Start</h4>
<p>For many organisations, becoming “next generation” isn’t a single leap - it’s a series of steps. It begins with a clear understanding of your current capabilities, data maturity, and business objectives.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>AI is everywhere. From self-service chatbots to sentiment analysis, call summarisation and agent assist - most customer service teams have either adopted AI tools or are exploring how to. The promise is clear: greater efficiency, faster resolutions, improved customer experiences.</p>
<p>But there’s a question I don’t hear asked enough:<br><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Is AI actually helping your team — or are you just throwing more tools at them and hoping for the best?</strong></span></p>
<p>In my experience, the difference between success and frustration often comes down to one thing: <strong>intentional implementation</strong>. And whether the people on the front line feel supported or sidelined by what’s been put in place.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The Risk of ‘Innovation Fatigue’</span></h3>
<p>When new tech lands without the right support or purpose, it doesn’t feel like progress - it feels like pressure. I’ve spoken to agents working in environments with multiple disconnected AI tools, each requiring a separate login or workflow. Far from making their job easier, it adds friction, reduces confidence, and increases the cognitive load of every interaction.</p>
<p>In these cases, AI isn’t an enabler - it’s just noise.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">What ‘Good’ Looks Like</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Simons%20blog%20-%20AI%20hinderance%20or%20help.jpg"" width=""852"" height=""479"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Simons blog - AI hinderance or help"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 852px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<p>The best implementations I’ve seen share some common traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI augments, not replaces: </strong>It supports agents in real time, not just by surfacing information but by reducing the effort required to act on it.</li>
<li><strong>It’s embedded into workflows: </strong>Not bolted on. The technology complements existing systems and makes sense in the context of the work, not outside of it.</li>
<li><strong>Training is prioritised: </strong>Not just how to use the tool, but why it matters. People understand the bigger picture and how it helps them deliver better service.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback loops are in place: </strong>Frontline teams can raise issues, suggest improvements, and feel ownership in how AI evolves over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>When these principles are applied, the shift is powerful. AI becomes less about automation and more about <em>amplification</em> - helping your people do what they do best, more confidently and more effectively.</p>
<p>Because the reality is: <strong>technology needs amazing people. And amazing people need technology that’s built to support them.</strong> One without the other rarely delivers lasting impact.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The Questions I’d Be Asking</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/AI%20Checklist%20-%20Simon%20Blog%20-%208th%20May.png"" width=""405"" height=""572"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""AI Checklist - Simon Blog - 8th May"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 405px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">If you're a senior leader considering (or already investing in) AI across your service organisation, here are a few questions worth asking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do our people know <em>why</em> we’re using this AI tool?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Has it actually reduced manual effort; or just moved it elsewhere?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How quickly can a new agent onboard and be confident using these tools?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can we see measurable improvements in customer outcomes, not just internal metrics?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are we listening to what our agents are telling us about these changes?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These questions aren’t about being critical. They’re about being conscious: because good customer service still depends on people. And those people need to be equipped, empowered, and heard.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Final Thought: AI is Only as Good as the Experience it Enables</span></h3>
<p>I’ve said it before: there’s no excuse for bad customer service. But I’d add to that - there’s no excuse for implementing AI that makes things harder for your people.</p>
<p>If it’s not helping your team deliver a better experience - faster, smarter, and more confidently - it might be time to stop and reassess. Technology should be in service of the people, not the other way around.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Nick Seagrave | CTO &amp; Co-Founder, CloudInteract</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Customer Experience (CX) is often seen as a critical function, yet many CX teams struggle to prove their real value. They report Net Promoter Scores (NPS), customer satisfaction ratings, and customer effort scores - but when it comes to securing investment and demonstrating business impact, these metrics often fall short.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Why? Because they don’t tell the full story.</span></p>
<h4>The Missing Piece: Measurement and Attribution</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Measurable-Impact-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""172"" height=""172"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Measurable-Impact-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 172px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">The language of business is and always will be the language of finance. If CX leaders can’t connect their work to revenue growth, retention, or margin improvement, they won’t get a seat at the executive table.</p>
<p>To do this well requires a crucial step - measurement and attribution. Many teams rush to report top-line CX metrics that feel impressive but lack the rigor needed to prove causation. Want to attribute revenue impact to customer service engagements? You need to be tracking every interaction in a scalable way. Want to understand how customer spend changed after an advocacy programme? Your financial data needs to be directly linked to your CX engagement data.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about data collection - it’s about strategy. And that means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capturing every engagement in a structured way.</strong> Without clean, trackable interactions, meaningful attribution is impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Running controlled experiments.</strong> We can learn a lot from product growth teams, who test causation instead of assuming correlation.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting financials to CX data.</strong> If your CX platforms aren’t integrated with revenue and margin data, you’re making decisions in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are Your Metrics Telling the Truth?</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Leadership-and-Vision-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""173"" height=""173"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Leadership-and-Vision-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 173px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Turns out, the devil is in the details. If your NPS measurements are skewed and designed to yield a high score rather than reflect genuine customer sentiment - and I’ve seen this happen time and time again - your metrics might look impressive in a slide deck, but they won’t hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>This is a common pitfall. If CX metrics don’t align with tangible business outcomes - like customer retention, expansion, or deal acceleration - then they fail to provide real strategic value.</p>
<h4>From Vanity Metrics to Business Drivers</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/vanithy%20metrics-1.png"" width=""379"" height=""296"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""vanithy metrics-1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 379px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; float: right;"">CX isn’t a vanity project. The teams that treat it as one are in the wrong job. Every CX metric should drive the business forward, whether by increasing revenue, improving retention, or enhancing profitability. The key is understanding how to measure this impact in a way that resonates at the executive level.</p>
<h5 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">So what does that look like?</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>Instead of tracking NPS in isolation, <strong>tie it to churn prevention.</strong> What percentage of detractors left? What did it cost the business?</li>
<li>Instead of celebrating high satisfaction scores, <strong>track how CX interventions influence deal acceleration.</strong> How many customers signed contracts faster after a successful onboarding experience?</li>
<li>Instead of measuring interactions, <strong>measure outcomes.</strong> What percentage of customers who engaged with a CX program expanded their contracts?</li>
</ul>
<p>CX leaders who understand this don’t just survive budget discussions - they shape them.</p>

By tracking and integrating customer interactions, revenue impact, and engagement outcomes, Apollo enables CX teams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and quantify the revenue at risk from customer churn.</li>
<li>Pinpoint expansion opportunities through real-time insights.</li>
<li>Directly connect CX performance to business growth metrics.</li>

If CX leaders want to drive real change, they need to start speaking the language of business - one that ties every experience back to measurable financial outcomes.</p>

At CloudInteract, we believe there’s no excuse for bad customer service. This philosophy, championed by our co-founder and CEO Simon Leyland, drives everything we do as we help businesses reimagine their customer interactions.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p>When we started CloudInteract, we set out to rid the world of rubbish contact centres. That might sound bold — but bad service is something none of us should accept anymore.</p>
<p>And we mean it when we say: <em>there’s no excuse for bad customer service.</em></p>
<p>Today, we’re more certain than ever that we can significantly improve any contact centre. One of the biggest issues we see time and again? Contact centres overwhelmed with simple, repetitive queries. In fact, agents spend more than 50% of their time answering straightforward, repeatable questions.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say that these should be handled via websites or text-based chatbots — but the reality is, people still like to pick up the phone. Those simple questions get lumped in with the complicated and complex ones, making it harder for customers with real issues to get the help they need.</p>
<h2>Our Two-Stage Approach</h2>
<p>At CloudInteract, we tackle this in two stages.</p>
<p><strong>Stage One</strong> is about getting under the skin of the problem. We give contact centres clear, detailed insight into what’s really going on — not just how long calls take, but what they’re <em>about</em>. We identify which queries are simple, which are complicated, and which are truly complex. We then make tailored recommendations on how to streamline, automate or enhance those experiences. During this phase, we also collect real-life questions and answers to help pre-populate knowledge bases and AI agents.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Two</strong> is where it gets exciting. We start deploying AI agents, using next-gen technology like <strong>AWS Nova Sonic</strong> and <strong>Amazon Connect Unlimited AI</strong> to handle those high-volume, simple queries. These agents are always-on, always-available, and can scale fast to meet spikes in demand — especially during critical or time-sensitive situations.</p>
<p>For your human agents, we use Amazon Q in Connect to give them the tools they need to quickly find answers to more complex or nuanced problems. This means faster responses, better service, and happier teams.</p>
<h2><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">So, What Does That Actually <em>Sound</em> Like?</span></h2>
<p>Let’s take a real-world example. One of our pharmacy clients receives a high volume of calls about temperature-sensitive deliveries. These are time-critical and often cause a huge spike in demand.</p>
<p>By placing an AI agent at the start of the call, we can resolve many of these queries immediately — while still offering the option to speak to a human. What’s different here is the <em>experience</em> — because thanks to clever engineering, this AI interaction doesn’t sound robotic. It sounds natural. Human. Helpful.</p>

<h4>🎧 <strong>Listen for yourself.</strong></h4>
<p>Here’s a short, voice-only demo using Amazon Nova Sonic. It’s a person talking to an AI chatbot — but you’d be forgiven for not knowing which is which. From tone and timing to the flow of the conversation, this is next-level voice tech in action.</p>
<p><span>🎧 Hit play, close your eyes, and see if you can tell where the human ends and the AI begins.</span></p>
<p>At <strong>CloudInteract</strong>, we believe there’s no excuse for bad customer service — and technology like Nova Sonic helps us reimagine how every conversation can feel more human, more helpful, and more connected.</p>

<p>It’s important we provide consistent, high-quality responses <em>across every channel</em> — and that’s why we favour <strong>Amazon Connect</strong>. With voice, text, chat, video, and AI agents all integrated into one platform, we can offer seamless, context-aware experiences, however your customers choose to get in touch.</p>

<p>Most organisations would say they care about customer experience. But in reality, many still treat contact centre interactions as isolated transactions - a ticket to be resolved, a call to be answered, a query to be closed.</p>
<!--more--><p>The shift comes when businesses start to see each interaction as more than just a moment in time. When they operate as if <em>every contact counts</em>, everything changes: for customers, for frontline teams, and for the organisation as a whole.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The Cost of Missed Moments</span></h4>
<p>When contact centres are under pressure with high volumes, disconnected systems, and generic scripts, it’s easy to fall into reactive mode. But every time a customer has to repeat themselves, is transferred between teams, or is given irrelevant advice, value is lost.</p>
<p>Not just in the immediate interaction, but in brand trust, customer retention, and team morale.</p>
<ul>
<li>A misrouted call can delay resolution by minutes - or days.</li>
<li>A missed opportunity to personalise the conversation can lead to churn.</li>
<li>A lack of context can result in unnecessary follow-ups and cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>These small moments accumulate - and they compound over time.</p>

<h4><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">What it Looks Like When Every Contact <em>Does</em> Count</span></h4>
<p>When businesses shift to a mindset where every interaction matters, we see clear differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversations become connected: </strong>Customers are recognised, not restarted. Agents can pick up the thread from previous interactions across voice and digital channels.</li>
<li><strong>Agents are empowered: </strong>They have the information and tools to resolve issues first time, with confidence and context.</li>
<li><strong>Decisions are driven by data: </strong>Leaders have real-time insight into what’s happening across teams, channels, and geographies - enabling faster course correction and continuous improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Customers feel seen and heard: </strong>Which builds long-term loyalty and brand advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">What Enables This?</span></h4>
<p>Technology plays a critical role - but only when it’s designed to serve the people using it.</p>
<p>That’s why we built <strong>Apollo</strong>. Not just to enhance the technology stack, but to support a more intentional, insight-led approach to customer interactions.</p>
<p>Apollo enables this mindset shift by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bringing data together in real time: </strong>So agents and supervisors have the full picture at the point of contact</li>
<li><strong>Supporting personalisation at scale: </strong>With relevant customer context surfaced automatically</li>
<li><strong>Enabling agility and experimentation: </strong>So teams can test, learn, and adapt faster</li>
<li><strong>Turning contact data into actionable insight: </strong>Not just for CX leaders, but across the business</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not just about doing more. It’s about doing <em>better</em> - because when every contact counts, better isn’t optional.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Mindset Before Metrics</span></h4>
<p>Ultimately, acting like every contact counts is a cultural and leadership shift as much as a technical one. It’s about embedding the belief that <em>every interaction is an opportunity</em> to solve, to connect, to improve.</p>
<p>The right technology supports this belief. It doesn’t replace the people who deliver the experience; it enables them to do it well, every time.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re ready to explore what this could look like for your organisation, let’s start a conversation.</strong> We’ll show you how Apollo helps contact centres move from transactional to transformational - one contact at a time.</p>

<h4>So, what is Nova Sonic — and why should we care?</h4>
<p>Put simply, Nova Sonic is a major step forward in making conversations with AI feel truly <em>human</em>.</p>
<p>Until now, AI-powered voice interactions - think voicebots, contact centre virtual agents, or digital assistants - have felt disjointed. The tech behind the scenes was stitched together like a relay race:</p>
<ul>
<li>One part transcribed your voice.</li>
<li>Another tried to work out what you meant.</li>
<li>A third generated a reply.</li>
<li>Then a final piece turned that into a voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>It worked, but you could hear the clunkiness. The awkward pauses. The robotic tone. And all of it chipped away at the kind of effortless experience we all strive to deliver.</p>
<p>Nova Sonic changes that. It’s a single, unified model that understands and responds in real time; just like a human would in conversation.</p>
<p>That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more unnatural gaps.</li>
<li>More lifelike tone, pace, and inflection.</li>
<li>A smoother, faster, more intuitive experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the kind of shift that could redefine what “good” sounds like in customer experience.</p>
<h4>What it means for CloudInteract — and our customers</h4>
<p>At CloudInteract, we’re all about reimagining how customers connect with the brands they choose. And voice plays a huge role in that. It’s the first impression, the tone-setter, the moment that can turn frustration into confidence - or the other way around.</p>
<p>Which is why we’re already on it.</p>
<p>Our engineering team is actively exploring how Nova Sonic can be integrated into the services we deliver; with the goal of creating <em>more natural, more empathetic, and more impactful</em> voice experiences for our clients.</p>
<p>Think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual agents that feel genuinely conversational (but scale like tech).</li>
<li>Customer journeys with less friction and more emotional intelligence.</li>
<li>A brand experience that feels human from the very first <em>“hello.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe Nova Sonic may well be the final piece of the puzzle when it comes to building truly natural voice automation. And we’re committed to unlocking its potential — not just because it’s exciting technology, but because it helps us do what we’re here to do: deliver meaningful, better experiences at scale.</p>

For CX leaders and change professionals, the true challenge lies not just in launching change but in embedding it. That’s where <em>Adoption Momentum</em> comes in.</p>

<p>This blog explores the five essential pillars that can help you create lasting adoption success - by focusing on the people behind the process, enabling progress, and driving cultural change. Whether you're rolling out a new contact centre platform, AI capability, or internal tools, these pillars will help you move beyond go-live to real, embedded transformation.</p>
<h4 style=""padding-left: 36pt;"">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership &amp; Vision: Set the Tone from the Top</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Leadership-and-Vision-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""207"" height=""207"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Leadership-and-Vision-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 207px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Change needs a champion - and that starts with leadership. When leaders visibly back a transformation, model the new behaviours, and consistently communicate the 'why,' teams are more likely to follow.</p>
<p>But it’s more than just cheerleading. It’s about linking the change to meaningful business goals and customer outcomes. When people understand how their work contributes to something bigger - and see that their leaders are invested - they’re far more likely to embrace change and carry it forward.</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Use leadership comms not just to inform, but to inspire. And make sure change is owned across the leadership team—not just by IT or project leads.</p>
<h4 style=""padding-left: 36pt;"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engaging &amp; Equipping Users: Empower People, Reduce Resistance</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Engaging-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""243"" height=""243"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Engaging-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 243px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">You can’t achieve sustained adoption without putting users at the heart of your strategy. Training should be more than a tick-box exercise. It should be relevant, role-specific, and continuous.</p>
<p>People need to feel confident - not just on Day 1, but as new features, tools, or workflows roll out. Peer learning, communities of practice, and on-demand resources go a long way in supporting users when they need help most.</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Empower early adopters to become advocates. Their real-world insights and support can reduce resistance and build peer trust.</p>
<h4 style=""padding-left: 36pt;"">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick Wins &amp; Measurable Impact: Show Progress Early</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Measurable-Impact-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""227"" height=""227"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Measurable-Impact-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 227px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Momentum builds when people see progress. Early success stories - especially when linked to real-world benefits like saved time, improved customer feedback, or better performance - help motivate teams and prove that the change is worth it.</p>
<p>Tracking the right metrics matters too. It’s not just about usage - it’s about value. What behaviours are changing? What outcomes are improving?</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Capture, share, and celebrate wins loudly and often. Storytelling fuels belief - and belief drives adoption.</p>
<h4 style=""padding-left: 36pt;"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback Loops &amp; Continuous Improvement: Listen, Adapt, Evolve</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Feedback-Loops-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""250"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Feedback-Loops-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Sustainable change doesn’t happen in a straight line. It evolves - and to evolve effectively, you need to listen.</p>
<p>Whether through structured surveys, drop-in sessions, or usage analytics, make it easy for users to share feedback - and act on it. This not only improves the experience but shows teams that their voices matter.</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Keep a visible backlog of user suggestions and updates. When people see their input reflected in the product or process, engagement grows.</p>
<h4 style=""padding-left: 36pt;"">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-Term Reinforcement &amp; Culture Shift: From Adoption to Evolution</h4>
<img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/5-Pillars_Mountain-Icon-Circle.jpg"" width=""246"" height=""246"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""5-Pillars_Mountain-Icon-Circle"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 246px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">
<p>Once the dust settles, the real work begins. Embedding new ways of working into everyday routines is critical for long-term success.</p>
<p>This means aligning new tools with daily workflows, rewarding champions, and continuing to communicate progress and evolution. The end goal? A culture that sees change as a constant - and adapts accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Make continuous improvement part of your operating rhythm. Create space for reflection, review, and re-education to keep your adoption momentum alive.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Ready to Build Adoption Momentum?</h4>

<h4 data-start=""1690"" data-end=""1732"">Agent Shift Bidding and Exchange</h4>
<p data-start=""1733"" data-end=""2019"">Now in FCS, agents can initiate shift trades with each other—without needing to take time off.<br data-start=""1827"" data-end=""1830"">Managers can choose which trades are auto-approved and which need manual sign-off, depending on customer segment or task criticality. A great step toward flexibility without losing control.</p>
<p data-start=""2021"" data-end=""2051"">🎥 <a data-start=""2024"" data-end=""2051"" rel=""noopener"" href=""#"">Watch the YouTube demo</a></p>
<h4 data-start=""2058"" data-end=""2091"">Dynamic Evaluation Forms</h4>
<p data-start=""2092"" data-end=""2332"">Say goodbye to form overload. Evaluation forms can now show or hide follow-up questions based on earlier responses. For example, if a customer made a purchase on a call, the form can automatically surface a question about sales disclosures.</p>

<h4 data-start=""2377"" data-end=""2427"">Proficiency-Based Routing – More Updates</h4>
<p data-start=""2428"" data-end=""2665"">Previously, routing criteria could be updated only three times while a contact waited in queue. That limit’s gone. You can now update routing criteria as many times as needed—although only the last three are stored for metrics reporting.</p>
<h4 data-start=""2672"" data-end=""2734"">Configure Amazon Q in Connect from the Admin Console</h4>
<p data-start=""2735"" data-end=""2944"">Admins can now set up AI agents, custom prompts, and content guardrails directly within the Amazon Connect admin site. This means less time jumping between tools, and more time getting the AI experience right.</p>
<p data-start=""2946"" data-end=""2987"">🔧 <a data-start=""2949"" data-end=""2987"" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://catalog.workshops.aws/amazon-q-in-connect/en-US"" target=""_blank"">Try the updated Amazon Q workshop</a></p>
<h4 data-start=""2994"" data-end=""3039"">Native Voicemail with IVR Recording</h4>
<p data-start=""3040"" data-end=""3309"">There’s now an AWS-provided GitHub solution for capturing voicemail <em data-start=""3108"" data-end=""3124"">in the IVR leg</em>—something that previously required Kinesis Video Streams. It creates a task and routes it to an agent with the voicemail recording attached. Fewer moving parts = easier implementation.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Customer experience has reached a tipping point. For years, businesses have optimised contact centres for efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing agent productivity - often at the expense of the customer. The result? Widespread frustration, rising attrition rates, and a contact centre model that is no longer fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Customers expect seamless, intelligent, and personalised interactions. They don’t have patience for long wait times, disjointed service, or robotic, scripted responses. Yet, many organisations remain locked into legacy thinking, measuring success with outdated KPIs that reward speed over substance and cost-cutting over customer value.</p>
<p>The truth is, we cannot keep applying efficiency-driven metrics to a system that is no longer efficient. It is time to fundamentally rethink the way we design, measure, and deliver customer experience.</p>
<h4>Why Traditional Contact Centre Models Are Failing</h4>
<p>The problem isn’t that contact centres aren’t trying to improve; it’s that they are solving the wrong things.</p>
<p>The industry has long prioritised <strong>efficiency over effectiveness - </strong>focusing on metrics such as average handle time, speed to answer, and abandonment rates. But these do not tell us whether customers actually got what they needed. The obsession with reducing costs has led to a system where <strong>customer service is often treated as a necessary expense rather than a strategic advantage</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, advances in AI and automation have created an expectation gap. Customers know that businesses have access to better tools, faster systems, and richer data than ever before. They don’t understand why they still have to repeat their issue three times, be transferred between departments, or explain their history every time they contact support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>👉 <a href=""/apollo-making-every-contact-count"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Head over to our Apollo Content Hub to read more about our advances in AI Data Intelligence&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The frustration isn’t just on the customer side. Agents are equally constrained by outdated processes. Many spend their time navigating <strong>fragmented systems, manually inputting data, or handling repetitive queries</strong> that could - and should - be automated. This is leading to <strong>burnout, disengagement, and high attrition rates</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not just a technology problem; it is a fundamental design flaw in how businesses think about customer experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-top: 18pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18pt; padding-left: 0cm;"">Pearson, a global education provider was struggling with an outdated contact centre that couldn’t scale, weighed down by high costs, rigid licensing, and limited AI integration. Partnering with CloudInteract, they moved to Amazon Connect, automating routine enquiries, optimising agent efficiency, and reducing operational costs - unlocking $7 million in projected savings over three years. This wasn’t about replacing people with AI but giving them the right tools to deliver better, faster, and more effective support.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Beyond Automation: Rethinking the Role of AI in CX</h4>
<p>The promise of AI in customer experience is often misunderstood. AI is not about <strong>replacing</strong> human service - it is about <strong>enhancing</strong> it. Yet, too many organisations either resist automation entirely or rush to implement it without a clear strategy.</p>
<p>The result is a disjointed experience: customers encountering <strong>unintelligent chatbots, frustrating self-service options, or AI-driven systems that lack real-world application</strong>.</p>
<p>The businesses that will thrive in the next evolution of CX are those that recognise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI should eliminate friction, not create it.</strong> It should remove the barriers that frustrate customers - such as lengthy verification processes, repetitive authentication, and unnecessary call transfers.</li>
<li><strong>AI should empower agents, not replace them.</strong> The role of automation is to handle the routine so that human expertise can be focused where it is most valuable - on complex, high-value interactions.</li>
<li><strong>AI should deliver real intelligence, not just automation.</strong> This means using AI to extract meaningful insights from customer interactions, identify patterns, and anticipate issues before they escalate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply automating what is broken will not fix the problem. AI must be <strong>intelligently applied</strong> to create a contact centre that is not just more efficient, but fundamentally better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-top: 18pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18pt; padding-left: 0cm;"">A leading digital healthcare provider was struggling with high call volumes, manual workflows, and limited visibility into customer interactions. Despite using Amazon Connect, they weren’t tapping into AI’s full potential. Partnering with CloudInteract, they deployed Apollo to enable real-time transcription and sentiment analysis, automate quality management, and streamline workforce scheduling. The result? A shift from a reactive, labour-intensive contact centre to an intelligent, insight-driven operation - boosting efficiency, improving agent performance, and enhancing service quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>{{cta('194157723885','justifycenter')}}</h4>
<h4>Fixing the Visibility Problem in CX</h4>
<p>One of the biggest reasons businesses struggle to improve customer experience is a lack of <strong>visibility</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you know why customers are really contacting your business?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can you see patterns in your contact centre data that reveal emerging customer needs?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do your agents have real-time access to the insights they need to resolve issues efficiently?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Too often, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Most contact centres operate in silos, with data trapped across multiple systems. This lack of integration means that <strong>customer history is incomplete, agent workflows are inefficient, and leadership teams make decisions based on lagging indicators rather than real-time intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>Without the ability to analyse and act on real customer interactions, businesses remain reactive - addressing issues only after they become problems.</p>
<p>Solving this requires more than just <strong>better reporting tools</strong>. It requires a fundamental shift in how businesses collect, analyse, and apply customer data. The contact centre must move from being a <strong>cost centre focused on resolution</strong> to an <strong>intelligence centre that drives business-wide customer strategy</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-top: 18pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18pt; padding-left: 0cm;"">Swoop, an adventure travel company needed to grow without losing the personal touch that set them apart. With CloudInteract and Amazon Connect, they gained real-time visibility into customer interactions, used AI-driven insights to refine service delivery, and built a foundation for seamless omnichannel engagement. For them, growth wasn’t just about automation - it was about making smarter, data-driven decisions to enhance every customer experience.</p>

<h4>Measuring What Matters: The Case for New CX Metrics</h4>

<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo/Apollo%20Quicksight%20Dashboard%20Screen%20Graphic.png"" width=""629"" height=""399"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Apollo Quicksight Dashboard Screen Graphic"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 629px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">For too long, the industry has relied on KPIs that reward speed and efficiency, often at the expense of customer satisfaction. A three-minute call that leaves a customer frustrated is not better than a twenty-minute call that resolves their issue and strengthens their loyalty.</p>
<p>The most forward-thinking organisations are shifting towards <strong>experience-driven metrics</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Effort Score (CES):</strong> How easy was it for the customer to get help?</li>
<li><strong>First Contact Resolution (FCR):</strong> Was the issue resolved in a single interaction?</li>
<li><strong>Agent Enablement Index:</strong> Do employees have the right tools and insights to serve customers effectively?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the metrics that <strong>truly reflect</strong> whether a contact center is delivering meaningful customer experiences.</p>
<p>By realigning KPIs to focus on <strong>outcomes rather than outputs</strong>, businesses can ensure they are driving the behaviours that lead to better service, stronger relationships, and long-term loyalty.</p>
<h4>What’s Next: The Future of CX</h4>
<p>The future of customer experience is not just about <strong>doing more with less</strong> - it is about <strong>doing better with what we have</strong>.</p>
<p>The businesses that will lead in CX over the next decade will be those that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognise AI as an enabler, not a disruptor.</strong> AI should enhance human interactions, not replace them.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritise insight over efficiency.</strong> Contact centres should be a <strong>source of intelligence</strong> that informs business strategy, not just a function that manages transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Redefine success beyond cost-cutting.</strong> Organisations must measure CX based on the <strong>value delivered to the customer</strong>, not just the cost saved by the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not just a <strong>technology shift</strong> - it is a <strong>mindset shift</strong>. And those who embrace it will create customer experiences that are not only more efficient but truly transformative.</p>

<h4><span>Welcome to our new series: Momentum: The Change Journey!&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>Change isn’t just about new technology or processes - it’s about people. <span style=""color: #cf389a;"">Momentum: The Change Journey </span>is a series dedicated to unlocking the power of effective change management, helping organisations move from resistance to readiness, and ensuring that transformation sticks. Through expert insights, practical strategies, and real-world stories, we’ll explore how to build adoption momentum and create lasting impact.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve got to be honest, sometimes leading change can feel like herding cats through a maze in a thunderstorm. Because business never stays the same, even similar initiatives can play out in very different ways. So, I want to talk about some real-world lessons that I’ve picked up along the way. </span></p>

<h2><span>The Rollercoaster of Change</span></h2>
<p><span><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/change%20rollercoaster.png"" width=""487"" height=""282"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""change rollercoaster"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 487px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Change is the only constant, and this goes for your plans too. It’s essential to have a solid strategy and a well-crafted plan but be ready to adjust and adapt on the fly. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s these times of crisis that really shape how people perceive your change. I’ve had projects where a series of just-managed-disasters were spoken of positively in years to come. I gained more grey hairs, and I felt like we’d barely made it by the skin of our teeth – but I got comments afterwards about how it was one of the best managed changes the employees had ever been through – that they couldn’t believe the amount of time and support we had for them, even though it wasn’t a perfectly smooth ride. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s really tempting to go for the short-term fix, or the knee-jerk reaction in times of crisis. But if you don’t force yourself to get some perspective and think strategically, you’ll create more problems down the line. So, if you’re like me, and react best when you feel in control, make sure that you have backup plans for emergencies. Figure out the most important parts of your change plan and decide in advance what options you have in the case of any…hiccups.</span></p>
<h2><span>Miscommunication</span></h2>
<p><span><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/volodymyr-hryshchenko-V5vqWC9gyEU-unsplash.jpg"" width=""393"" height=""262"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""volodymyr-hryshchenko-V5vqWC9gyEU-unsplash"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 393px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Sometimes it’s easy to overlook the team delivering the change. We get so involved in mapping, assessing and communicating with the impacted employees that we forget about our own people. </span></p>
<p><span>Project teams are usually a collaborative force, drawn together from a couple of different parts of the business, perhaps with loaned, part-time or contractual resources thrown in. Do you have robust systems of communication and collaboration in place for your internal team? Does everyone know who is doing what, for who, and when? </span></p>
<p><span>If you can engineer a new way of working for others, you can put in place a few simple controls and checkpoints to keep your own crew up-to-date, aligned and motivated. </span></p>
<p><span>Fail to do this and you’ll find challenges harder to deal with and will probably create a few unnecessary ones of your own that could have been avoided. You wouldn’t believe the number of mishaps that could be avoided if the project team were better aligned. </span></p>
<h2><span>People aren’t perfect</span></h2>
<p><span>No one has an unlimited budget (but if you know someone who does, introduce me - I’ve got some great ideas for spending it)! </span></p>
<p><span>In reality, even the best-planned changes won't be perfect. This often makes people feel like imposters because there's a big gap between what theories, research, and blogs say and what's actually doable. This can make us feel pretty inadequate.</span></p>
<p><span>But don’t worry; everyone works with limited teams, budgets, and resources. The trick is in how you use them. That’s where one of the best tools in your arsenal should come into play – the change impact assessment. Use the impact assessment to figure out where your most critical factors are – the biggest risks, potential impacts, and what could derail your project.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few simple questions – if you can’t answer them, then you aren’t ready for your change: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Who will be impacted by the change </span>– exactly how many people, in how many teams, and in which parts of the business (and which locations)?</span></li>
<li><span><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">How much do they know about the change?</span> Who are they mostly likely to listen/pay attention to at work – what are those people telling them about the change? </span></li>
<li><span><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Out of all the roles affected by the change</span> – which one is most impacted (i.e. biggest difference to their day to day) and which one is most important to the business (i.e. biggest business risk)? <em>Hint: these may not be the same! </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It may seem like a lot of detail but if your project doesn’t have this info you’re flying blind, making it way harder to manage resources efficiently and avoid last-minute crises. This can hurt the overall success of what could be an amazing change initiative.</span></p>
<h2><span>Power players</span></h2>
<p><span>Outside of your project team, there are some key people who you need to focus on because they can make your change infinitely easier (or harder). </span></p>
<h4><strong><span>The Top Dog</span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>First up is an engaged Executive. Find the most senior person who cares about what you’re doing – this may be the project Executive Sponsor, or their boss, or the head honcho of the whole place. This is your ‘big gun’ – don’t expect them to be in the details, but they’ll launch you off the starting line and can perk up an initiative that’s flagging in the middle. </span></li>
<li><span>Can you deliver change without this Executive? Yes. But it’ll feel like you’re doing it with lead balloons tied to your feet. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span>Business Collaborators </span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Next, we have your stakeholders. These are key people across the impacted business who may not have the final say but are going to have a strong opinion and probably won’t be shy about giving it. They have seniority and expertise in the areas you’re affecting, and you need to work closely with them to get the green light.</span></li>
<li><span>In my personal opinion, “managing stakeholders” sets things off on the wrong foot. “Engaging stakeholders” would be a better start – if these experts and key representatives aren’t convinced about your change, then you’re about to go off the rails. When they believe in what you’re doing, stakeholders can be powerful (and essential) amplifiers.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span>Influencers</span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Finally, let's talk about team dynamics. Think back to every team you’ve ever worked with, and you’ll soon find a few key characters reappearing – the person who was always keen on new things, and the deeply entrenched skeptic. Now think about how often their strong opinions held sway with the rest of the team who were mostly on the fence. </span></li>
<li><span>Focus your efforts tapping into the enthusiasts. Boost their voices – give them the tools, information and support they need to be advocates for your change, and you’ll positively influence the rest of the team (although the skeptic might never get onboard). These are your early adopters, your change agents, your champions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While you might pull off successful change without these groups, having them involved makes everything easier, smoother, and way more effective.</span></p>
<h2><span>Where’s the Kool-Aid? </span></h2>
<p><span><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/koolaid.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""234"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""koolaid"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 240px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">As change leaders, it’s critical to believe in the change we're advocating – we must “drink our own Kool-Aid”. If we don't, how can we expect others to? Share your vision, your passion, and your belief in the change. And if you don’t believe in the change, then work out why and fix it. Positivity is infectious so celebrate publicly and often, even if the wins seem small. </span></p>
<p><span>Leading change in complex organizations isn’t for the faint-hearted. It requires resilience, adaptability, and a whole lot of heart. Remember, it’s not about having the perfect resources or time. It’s about making the most of what you have, prioritising effectively, and celebrating every step forward.</span></p>
<p><span>So, to all the change leaders out there, keep pushing, keep believing, and keep celebrating those small victories. You’ve got this! </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It’s 2025, and people still can’t send a message to their bank when a transaction goes missing. Instead, they’re forced to call at the hours that suit the bank, not the customer. No digital contact options, no real-time self-service, just a static FAQ page that, unsurprisingly, doesn’t have the answers needed. And it’s not just one company - this is happening across industries.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">We’ve all been there. Desperately needing support, only to be met with friction at every turn. No digital channels. No flexibility. No empathy.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I understand the internal justifications. Legacy systems. Compliance restrictions. Fear of change. But none of these should stand in the way of offering a simple, effective way for customers to contact you. At the very least, let them send a message.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/tolu-akinyemi-FugPlkCOf2U-unsplash.jpg"" width=""486"" height=""323"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""tolu-akinyemi-FugPlkCOf2U-unsplash"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 486px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Here’s a reality check: the companies making it hard for customers to get in touch aren’t saving money - they’re handing customers over to competitors. Every interaction is an opportunity. Every touchpoint builds trust (or erodes it). The cost of acquiring a new customer is significantly higher than keeping an existing one, yet many brands invest heavily in marketing only to let customers slip away when they actually need support.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The financial sector is particularly guilty of this. Some banks still refuse to offer even the most basic digital service options. Others cut voice support down to the bare minimum, frustrating customers to the point where they’ll do anything to avoid calling.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">And then there are the horror stories. One major bank cancelled all of a customers’ cards on Christmas Eve due to ‘suspicious activity’ - but their security team was off until December 27. No override. No escalation. Just a system that said no. Lucky for them, they had another card. Not everyone does.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Welcome to our new series: Momentum: The change Journey!&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>Change isn’t just about new technology or processes - it’s about people. <span style=""color: #cf389a;"">Momentum: The Change Journey </span>is a series dedicated to unlocking the power of effective change management, helping organisations move from resistance to readiness, and ensuring that transformation sticks. Through expert insights, practical strategies, and real-world stories, we’ll explore how to build adoption momentum and create lasting impact.</span></p>
<p>Is it just me or has adoption become a project buzz word? Yes, the word ‘adopt’ can also mean to ‘use’ something – but I guarantee that handsome bottom line of your benefits spreadsheet assumes that people aren’t just ‘doing’ the new thing – they’re doing it <em>well. </em>Ready to save your company from low ROI, disengaged teams and one giant headache? Welcome, to the hidden costs of poor adoption.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The 100% Illusion</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/alexander-schimmeck-Aohf8gqa7Zc-unsplash.jpg"" width=""447"" height=""297"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""alexander-schimmeck-Aohf8gqa7Zc-unsplash"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 447px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Picture this: your company rolls out shiny new technology and, voila, everyone’s using it! That’s 100% adoption, right? Not so fast. If you don’t put in the work to change existing processes and behaviours, you’re not going to see those promised boosts in productivity, security, or customer satisfaction. It’s like buying an airplane and then using it to drive around on the ground.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between use and adoption, and every business case I’ve seen has a built-in assumption that there are going to be productivity, efficiency or optimisation gains because of the shiny new tool. But does that business case also feature sufficient resources to ensure a high rate of adoption? Hmmm.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into some juicy real-world examples to see what we mean:</p>
<h4>Undermining Machine Learning</h4>
<p>You introduce a new forecasting system to nail agent scheduling and capacity planning in a contact centre, so no customer is left waiting too long at peak times. Its predictive analysis is based on historic data and machine learning, so the more you use it, the better it gets. Awesome right? Except that some teams have reached change overload and decide to keep managing vacation and overtime through good old spreadsheets and forms. The result? There’s still some benefit, but 50+ people are still doing something manually because it’s what they’re used to.</p>
<h4>Data Black Holes</h4>
<p>You’ve upgraded to a scalable, cloud-based solution with cutting-edge customer sentiment analysis. Every interaction automatically generates data about how the customer felt throughout the conversation, key triggers, talk vs listening time and more. The potential! This could be used for training, incentives, performance reviews and upselling opportunities. Except that nothing happens with your new report. The headline NPS is shared with the business once a month and voila – what a missed opportunity.</p>
<h4>Modern Working the Old Way</h4>
<p>You expand the features of your online collaboration tools – enabling version history, co-authoring and key content labels for secure external sharing. Gone are the version errors of the past, gone are the hours wasted working on duplicates, gone are the enormous data storage costs…or are they? Your employees continue to email physical copies instead of sharing links and save new files for every version. Rocket ship to the future, crashed.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">The Butterfly Effect</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/aarn-giri-IBhsB71R97k-unsplash.jpg"" width=""253"" height=""450"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""aarn-giri-IBhsB71R97k-unsplash"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 253px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">The impact of poor user adoption isn’t just a one-off issue. It spreads like wildfire, eroding benefits and return on investment, and forcing extra investment to fix new issues caused by not using things as intended<em>.</em></p>
<p>Now, picture the impact on your teams – they've had a rocky change experience and are left clueless about their new tools. Their daily grind just got a whole lot tougher – and they’re being criticised for not delivering the improved results that were expected. Are they going to be at their best? Probably not.</p>
<p>At best, you’re looking at significant drops in productivity, morale, and goodwill both during and after the project. At worst, your top talent might jump ship for greener pastures – and their replacements will simply inherit the same inefficient habits.</p>
<p>Change is hard work and impacts productivity even before launch – those months of prep, announcements, workshops and training add up, all on top of regular duties. The secret to keeping everyone engaged and productive through all stages? Investing in solid change management – otherwise, you're watering down the business benefits before the change even takes off.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Strategies for Successful User Adoption</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Our%20Difference.jpg"" width=""342"" height=""228"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Our Difference"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 342px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; float: right;"">So, how do we turn this ship around? Here are some strategies to get everyone on board for a smoother transition and better realisation of those juicy benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Clear Communication:</span> We need to make sure everyone knows what’s going on, why we’re doing it, and what’s in it for them. Be genuine and authentic when addressing their doubts and paint a clear picture of the change journey.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Tailored Training: </span>Forget one-size-fits-all. Create customised training that goes beyond the technical stuff. Don’t just leave it to the technical team to talk about features, make sure the business teams are ready to revamp their processes and include this in the training – this way, they’ll be ready to make the most out of the new tools.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Continuous Support: </span>Keep the support flowing! From help desks to user guides and regular check-ins, be there every step of the way to iron out any issues and make sure that support teams are aligned with process changes and best practice advice as well.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Incentivise Adoption:</span> Let’s celebrate the early adopters! Recognise and reward those who are smashing it with the new processes. This will boost morale and inspire others to join the party.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Wrapping It Up</h4>
<p>So, did you spot these hidden costs? I bet you a coffee you won’t find them in any risk or benefits spreadsheets!</p>
<p>I think these pitfalls can be seriously underestimated by business leaders focussed on the potential benefits – never realising that their big picture could be seriously undermined before they even start.</p>
<p>The good news is that by recognising these challenges and using smart strategies to boost real adoption, companies can truly unlock the full potential of their investments. And better adoption means happier, more productive people (I mean, who wants their work to be harder or less efficient!?). Remember, true transformation is more than just skin-deep changes - it calls for a committed effort to alter behaviours and processes for lasting impact.</p>

","2025-02-25 17:02:15","2025-03-03 06:30:01","<h2>Mastering User Adoption in Amazon Connect</h2>
<p>User adoption - it’s the often-overlooked factor that determines whether a new technology implementation is a success or a struggle. In the latest ACP Podcast, hosts Tom Morgan and Alex Baker dive into why bringing people along for the journey is just as important as getting the technical setup right when rolling out Amazon Connect. From the latest product updates to the role of AI in improving agent performance, here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>{{cta('213075106005','justifycenter')}}</p>
<h4><strong>User Adoption: The Key to Success</strong></h4>
<p>One of the biggest pitfalls in contact centre technology rollouts is assuming that a well-executed technical deployment automatically leads to a successful project. In reality, the real challenge often lies in user adoption. If agents, supervisors, and business users aren’t engaged and supported, even the best technology can go underutilised.</p>
<h4><strong>Start With “Why”</strong></h4>
<p>For any organisation moving to Amazon Connect, it’s crucial to understand and articulate the <strong>why</strong> behind the transition. Whether upgrading from a legacy contact centre or implementing a formal contact centre for the first time, decision-makers need to clearly communicate the benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved agent workflows</li>
<li>Greater flexibility and scalability</li>
<li>Enhanced reporting and analytics</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Address Resistance to Change</strong></h4>
<p>Change is hard - especially when it impacts people’s daily routines. Agents accustomed to older systems may resist a new interface or workflow unless they understand the advantages. Leaders and technical teams must be prepared to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Educate early</strong> </span>– Communicate what’s changing and why, well before the rollout.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Listen to concerns</strong></span> – Acknowledge fears about change and address them with tangible solutions.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Demonstrate quick wins</strong></span> – Show how the new system simplifies their work, not just adds complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The Role of Training</strong></h4>
<p>Training is an essential component of user adoption, but it must be tailored to different user groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Agents</strong></span> – Focus on ease of use and efficiency in their daily tasks.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Supervisors &amp; Managers</strong></span> – Ensure they can access and analyse performance data effectively.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Quality &amp; Compliance Teams</strong></span> – Provide specialised training on evaluations, reporting, and adherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller teams, informal training may be sufficient, but in large enterprises, structured onboarding is necessary to maintain consistency.</p>
<h4><strong>AI &amp; Automation: Enabling, Not Replacing Agents</strong></h4>
<p>The rise of AI in contact centres has led to concerns about job displacement, but the real opportunity lies in <strong>augmenting</strong> human agents, not replacing them. AI-driven tools like <strong>Amazon Q</strong> can support agents by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing real-time assistance and knowledge retrieval.</li>
<li>Automating repetitive queries (e.g., “Where is my order?” inquiries).</li>
<li>Enhancing agent workflows to focus on high-value interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By removing routine, low-value tasks, AI allows agents to focus on complex and emotionally sensitive customer interactions where human empathy is irreplaceable.</p>
<h4><strong>Continuous Adoption &amp; Optimisation</strong></h4>
<p>User adoption isn’t a one-time event - it’s an ongoing process. Organisations should:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Regularly review Amazon Connect updates</strong></span> to take advantage of new features.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Refine training programmes</strong></span> based on evolving business needs and new hires.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Leverage managed services</strong></span> to stay up to date with best practices and innovations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of any Amazon Connect implementation depends on more than just getting the technology right. Engaging agents, supervisors, and stakeholders throughout the process ensures that new capabilities are effectively utilised, enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>By prioritising user adoption from day one - and sustaining it through training, AI integration, and ongoing optimisation - organisations can maximise the value of Amazon Connect and future-proof their contact centers.</p>

<p>Automation is a hot topic in the contact centre space right now, especially as AI continues to shape the landscape of customer service. But as Tom Morgan and Alex Baker explore in the latest episode of the ACP podcast, automation isn’t just about AI. It’s about leveraging technology to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately enhance the customer experience.</p>
<p>{{cta('213075104988','justifycenter')}}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>What Do We Mean by Automation?</strong></h4>
<p>Automation in the contact centre is all about using technology to handle tasks that traditionally required human intervention. This could mean improving efficiencies, reducing costs, or even enabling new capabilities that weren’t previously possible. More importantly, automation should go beyond cost-cutting to actually enhance the customer and agent experience.</p>
<h4><strong>The True Value of Automation</strong></h4>
<p>While automation is often associated with improving productivity, it’s not just about doing more with less. Tom and Alex emphasize that automation should be focused on improving customer interactions, empowering agents, and driving business efficiencies. Some key benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Enhanced customer experience:</strong></span> Automation can help route calls more effectively, provide instant responses, and reduce wait times.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Empowered agents:</strong></span> By automating repetitive tasks, agents can focus on more complex and meaningful customer interactions.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Reduced operational costs:</strong> </span>Streamlining workflows and self-service options can lower the burden on human agents and optimise resources.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Scalability:</strong></span> Businesses can handle higher volumes of interactions without needing to exponentially grow their workforce.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Where Automation Shows Up in the Contact Centre</strong></h4>
<p>There are multiple areas where automation is already making an impact in Amazon Connect and the wider contact centre ecosystem:</p>
<strong style=""color: #f40876; font-size: 22px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"">1. Routing and IVR Enhancements</strong><br>
<p>One of the earliest forms of automation in contact centres was the IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, which replaced manual switchboards. Today, automation is evolving beyond simple “Press 1 for Sales” menus to AI-driven chatbots and voice assistants that can understand and route queries more effectively.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">2. Self-Service Capabilities</strong></h4>
<p>Automation enables customers to resolve their issues without speaking to an agent. Whether it’s checking an order status, resetting a password, or requesting a refund, self-service systems powered by AI and natural language processing can drastically improve efficiency.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">3. Agent Assistance &amp; Workflow Automation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Step-by-Step Guidance:</strong></span> Providing agents with real-time guided workflows based on customer interactions.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Knowledge Base Integration:</strong> </span>Using AI to surface relevant information to agents during live calls.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Post-Call Follow-Ups: </strong></span>Automatically sending customers summaries of their interactions via SMS or email.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">4. Outbound Campaigns &amp; Proactive Engagement</strong></h4>
<p>Amazon Connect’s outbound dialer allows businesses to automate proactive customer engagement across multiple channels. This means businesses can reach out to customers via SMS, email, or phone calls to send reminders, promotions, or service updates efficiently.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">5. Quality Monitoring &amp; AI-Powered Evaluations</strong></h4>
<p>Traditional quality monitoring often involves manually reviewing a small sample of calls per agent. With automation, businesses can analyze every call, ensuring compliance, assessing agent performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Amazon Connect’s Contact Lens can even use AI to evaluate customer interactions in real time.</p>
<h4><strong style=""background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"">6. Automated Testing for Reliability</strong></h4>
<p>One often-overlooked area of automation is testing. Instead of manually checking if a contact center system is working, businesses can use automated testing tools to simulate customer interactions and ensure everything is functioning correctly at all times.</p>
<h4><strong>Take Action: Conduct an Automation Audit</strong></h4>
<p>Tom and Alex suggest that businesses conduct an “automation audit” to assess where they currently stand and where they could implement automation. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>List all current automated processes</strong></span> – Identify what’s already in place and working.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Identify opportunities for further automation</strong></span> – Look for areas where automation could improve efficiency or enhance CX.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Assess AI-readiness</strong></span> – Understand where AI could be incorporated and how it aligns with your data and business processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automation is no longer a futuristic concept - it’s here, and it’s evolving rapidly. Whether it’s optimising call routing, empowering agents, enhancing self-service, or automating quality monitoring, businesses that embrace automation will be better equipped to provide exceptional customer experiences.</p>

<p>Hot off the press from our resident <span>Contact Centre Consultant and AWS Solution Architect</span>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-baker-2126b23/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alex Baker</a>. Let’s dive into what’s new this month:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
{{cta('212022526157')}}<br>
<h2>Key Enhancements in This Release</h2>
<h4><strong>Persistent Agent Connections (Public Preview)</strong></h4>
<p>Connecting customers to agents faster is crucial, especially for outbound campaigns. Amazon Connect now offers persistent agent connections, reducing the time needed to establish a call by keeping an open channel between the agent’s softphone and Amazon Connect. This feature ensures compliance with regulations like the US Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by maintaining quick connection times.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces call connection delays</li>
<li>Enhances agent efficiency for outbound dialling</li>
<li>Improves compliance with telemarketing laws</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Screen Recording for AWS GovCloud (US-West)</strong></h4>
<p>Government and public sector organisations can now use screen recording in AWS GovCloud (US-West). This feature enhances compliance and security for government entities using Amazon Connect.</p>
<h4><strong>Improved Audio Optimisation for Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces</strong></h4>
<p>Agents using Citrix or Amazon WorkSpaces Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) can now redirect audio to their local devices, improving voice quality and reducing latency. This enhancement ensures that calls handled on virtual desktops provide a better experience for both customers and agents.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires a simple query parameter in the Agent Workspace URL</li>
<li>Works for non-SSO and SSO users with relay state updates</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Automatic Agent Performance Evaluation Emails</strong></h4>
<p>Agent performance tracking just got more efficient. Supervisors can now set up automated emails to notify agents when their calls are evaluated. This allows them to quickly review feedback, improve performance, and stay aligned with quality standards.</p>
<p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time feedback for agents</li>
<li>Custom rules to trigger notifications based on evaluation scores</li>
<li>Streamlined coaching and performance tracking</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conditionally Required Fields in Amazon Connect Cases</strong></h4>
<p>Data accuracy is critical in customer support. This new feature allows admins to create conditionally required fields in Amazon Connect Cases, ensuring that agents capture the right information at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “Close Reason” field becomes mandatory when a case is closed</li>
<li>A “Product Serial Number” is required when the issue type is hardware-related</li>
<li>A “Disposition Code” is needed for system-generated cases</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Customisable Agent Schedule Adherence Tracking</strong></h4>
<p>Amazon Connect now lets you map agent statuses more flexibly to schedule activities. This means you can define which states are considered ""adherent,"" improving workforce tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>If an agent is scheduled for ""Work,"" they can now be in either ""Available"" or ""Back-office Work"" and still be considered adherent.</p>
<h4><strong>Multi-Proficiency Routing Enhancement</strong></h4>
<p>Routing just got more powerful. You can now target up to four agent proficiency combinations in a single routing step. This means contacts have a better chance of being matched with a skilled agent, improving resolution rates.</p>
<h4><strong>New Agent Performance Evaluation Dashboard</strong></h4>
<p>A new Agent Performance Dashboard provides unified insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation scores</li>
<li>Productivity metrics (contacts handled, average handle time, etc.)</li>
<li>Trends and performance comparisons over time</li>
</ul>
<p>This dashboard helps supervisors easily identify agent strengths and areas for improvement at a glance.</p>
<h4><strong>Generative AI Use Cases Workshop</strong></h4>
<p>Amazon Connect’s Generative AI capabilities continue to expand, and now there’s a dedicated workshop covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-service experiences powered by Generative AI</li>
<li>Agent evaluations and conversational analytics</li>
<li>AI-powered agent assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>This self-paced AWS workshop is available online and is highly recommended for teams exploring the full potential of Generative AI in customer interactions.</p>
<h4><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h4>
<p>This release brings powerful enhancements to Amazon Connect, from faster call handling to AI-driven insights and agent performance tracking. These updates provide businesses with more control, efficiency, and better customer experiences.</p>

<h4><span>Welcome to our series: Momentum: The Change Journey!&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliza-taylor-696bb636/vvv"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eliza Taylor | Change Director</a></span></p>
<p><span>Change isn’t just about new technology or processes - it’s about people. <span style=""color: #cf389a;"">Momentum: The Change Journey </span>is a series dedicated to unlocking the power of effective change management, helping organisations move from resistance to readiness, and ensuring that transformation sticks. Through expert insights, practical strategies, and real-world stories, we’ll explore how to build adoption momentum and create lasting impact.</span></p>
<p>Change is an essential part of growth for any organisation, but let’s face it - change often meets resistance. Whether you’re introducing new strategies, technologies, or processes, the key is to transform that resistance into readiness.</p>
<!--more--><span style=""color: #f40876; font-size: 22px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"">Explain the Why</span>
<p>It may sound odd, but sometimes leaders skip the '<strong>why</strong>' and dive straight into the '<strong>what</strong>'. But that 'why' is the golden key to your success (or without it, the start of a bumpy ride).</p>
<p>Words like “improvement”, “efficiency”, or “optimisation” just won't cut it. There's always a bigger picture. Are you moving resources into new strategic areas, aiming for a fresh market or product, trying to keep pace with competitors, shaking off legacy tech no longer fit-for-purpose, or charting a bold, new direction for the company? Share that story with your people!</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: Your business is probably juggling multiple changes at once. Aligning all these initiatives with your high-level goals makes everything feel like part of a grand plan, rather than a chaotic jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<h4>Listen Up</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Bullhorn%20icon.png"" width=""224"" height=""224"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Bullhorn icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 224px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Big announcements from key leaders are a great start, but let’s be real – they're just the tip of the iceberg. Think about how many unread emails are sitting in your inbox right now. You can't just drop a bombshell and walk away.</p>
<p>You need a steady stream of communication throughout your project. This isn’t just to keep everyone in the loop; it’s to keep the excitement alive, gauge reactions, and build momentum as you rack up those wins.</p>
<p>Take a broad approach when it comes to engagement and communication. Don’t just engage stakeholders; dive into employee forums, arrange Q&amp;A sessions (like roadshows or lunch n’ learns), and recruit champions who can spread the word in every corner of your business.</p>
<p>Opening up two-way communication channels takes effort, but it’s worth it. It’s not just about making sure your workforce feels heard; sometimes, you’ll get critical insights that stop the project derailing. Trust me, those red flags have saved the day more than once!</p>
<h4>Idealism Meets Realism</h4>
<p><em>“This is our most important internal initiative – budget is no issue, just get it done well.” </em>Said almost no company, ever.</p>
<p>Business is business, and the reality often involves tight resources and teams stretched thin. You still need to get everyone on board with the change, making sure they’re actively involved while juggling their daily tasks, but you don’t have endless time or resources to make this happen.</p>
<p>Balancing ideal solutions with practical constraints is key. In a perfect world, you’d have custom workshops, face-to-face engagement, plenty of incentives, and bespoke training for every part of the business that everyone attends. But let's face it, most projects can’t hit all those marks.</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Journey%20icon.png"" width=""260"" height=""260"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Journey icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 260px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">So, use your resources wisely. Focus on what truly makes a difference. If time and people are in short supply, think about a train-the-trainer approach to spread the knowledge. Prioritise workshops for the folks who will feel the impact the most. Even if you can't create the perfect experience, aim to make a real difference where it counts.</p>
<h4>Can You be Trusted?</h4>
<p>Let’s be honest – everyone has at least one example of a poor change experience, where cryptic messaging and emergency action delivered lots of pain with very little benefit.</p>
<p>Trust reduces resistance. You want employees to trust that their leaders care about the impact and are being as transparent and supportive as they can, even when they are facing the toughest decisions. This isn’t about ‘spinning’ the story – trust significantly affects your ability to keep talent and do business, as well as how agile you can be in change.</p>
<p>Make sure you deliver, if you say that employees will be consulted, trained and supported – believe me, employees will definitely notice if they aren't.</p>
<h4>Maintaining Momentum</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Chatbot%20icon.png"" width=""219"" height=""219"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Chatbot icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 219px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Recognise that change takes effort. It’s not always easy, but it's worth it. Acknowledge those who jump in with both feet. Celebrate small wins. As change fatigue grows, you can rejuvenate your programme by highlighting teams that are making progress, using them as positive examples of future benefits.</p>
<p>When things get bumpy (and they will), tackle problems constructively and with understanding. Nobody wants a blame game – we all want solutions and a chance to learn from mistakes without fear of being singled out.&nbsp; Fear will grow resistance.</p>
<p>Making change happen isn’t just about implementing new processes or systems – it’s about creating an environment where people feel proud, motivated, and ready to tackle the future. Keep the energy high, communication flowing, and celebrate those wins. Your enthusiasm will be contagious, and soon you’ll have a team that’s not just ready for change but ready for it.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Turning resistance into readiness isn’t a walk in the park, but it’s definitely doable with the right approach. Picture this: a clear vision, open and honest communication, and plenty of feedback flying back and forth. Show your team you appreciate their hard work, build trust by standing by your promises, and get everyone from top to bottom involved.</p>
<p>Above all, your company, your people and your change are unique. There isn’t a cookie-cutter fix all. You need to take the time, every time, to understand your context to authentically address resistance.</p>

","2025-01-31 16:08:54","2025-02-12 07:00:00","<h2>The Power of Collaboration: How to Foster Cross-Departmental Synergy</h2>
<p>In every organisation, departments often operate like separate islands - each with its own goals, processes, and perspectives. While this specialisation is necessary, it can also lead to silos that hinder innovation, slow progress, and limit organisational growth.</p>
<p>Cross-departmental collaboration is the antidote to these challenges, fostering a culture of shared knowledge, diverse perspectives, and collective problem-solving.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here are actionable strategies to break down barriers and build bridges across departments:</p>
<h4>1. Highlight Shared Goals</h4>
<p>Instead of focusing on departmental objectives, emphasise overarching organisational goals that unite teams. Whether it’s improving customer satisfaction, streamlining operations, or boosting employee engagement, shared priorities can create a natural foundation for collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Shared goals align efforts, reduce competition, and provide a clear reason to collaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A customer service team and IT department working together to implement a new CRM system that enhances customer experience while reducing support response times.</p>
<h4>2. Facilitate Cross-Departmental Forums and Events</h4>
<p>Create spaces where employees from different departments can connect, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. These could be workshops, brainstorming sessions, or informal town halls.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Forums break down silos, foster relationships, and encourage knowledge exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An organisation hosting a ""Hack Your Workflow"" event where teams from HR, finance, and operations identify inefficiencies and develop solutions together.</p>
<h4>3. Build Cross-Functional Teams</h4>
<p>Assemble teams with members from various departments to tackle specific challenges or initiatives. This approach brings diverse expertise to the table and encourages creative problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Cross-functional teams blend unique skills, driving innovative solutions that single departments might not achieve alone.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A marketing team collaborates with product development and sales to create a go-to-market strategy for a new product, ensuring alignment across customer needs, messaging, and delivery.</p>
<h4>4. Leverage Technology to Enable Collaboration</h4>
<p>Invest in digital platforms that allow departments to share updates, collaborate on projects, and communicate seamlessly. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Viva Engage can serve as bridges between teams.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Technology removes barriers like location and workflow discrepancies, creating a common space for collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Using shared dashboards to track project milestones ensures transparency between the marketing and supply chain teams working on a product launch.</p>
<h4>5. Foster Peer-to-Peer Learning</h4>
<p>Encourage departments to share insights, best practices, and lessons learned through structured programs like mentorships or lunch-and-learns.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Peer learning helps teams gain a broader understanding of organisational processes and creates mutual respect between departments.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A finance team sharing strategies for budgeting efficiency with department heads, fostering smarter resource allocation across the organisation.</p>
<h4>6. Promote Transparency and Trust</h4>
<p>Collaboration thrives when departments trust one another. Create a culture of openness by sharing updates, success stories, and even failures across the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Transparency builds trust, reduces misunderstandings, and encourages teams to support one another.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An executive team sharing company-wide progress updates on a major transformation initiative, recognising contributions from all departments.</p>
<h4>7. Recognise and Celebrate Collaborative Successes</h4>
<p>Publicly acknowledge teams that achieve success through cross-departmental efforts. This reinforces the value of collaboration and motivates others to follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Recognition boosts morale, encourages teamwork, and reinforces a collaborative culture.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Highlighting a partnership between HR and IT that streamlined onboarding processes, resulting in faster integration of new hires.</p>
<h4>8. Provide Cross-Departmental Incentives</h4>
<p>Encourage departments to collaborate by tying performance metrics or incentives to shared goals.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Incentives align priorities and provide tangible reasons for teams to work together.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A reward &amp; recognition programme that recognises both the sales and customer success teams for improving customer retention rates.</p>
<h4>9. Encourage Open Innovation</h4>
<p>Invite teams to openly share ideas and participate in projects outside their usual scope. This not only fosters innovation but also broadens employees’ understanding of organisational challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Open innovation breaks the boundaries of departmental expertise, encouraging fresh perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An internal competition where employees pitch ideas to improve the company’s sustainability practices, regardless of their role.</p>
<h4>10. Measure and Share Impact</h4>
<p>Track and report on the tangible benefits of cross-departmental collaboration, such as cost savings, process efficiencies, or employee satisfaction improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Demonstrating measurable outcomes validates the effort and encourages ongoing collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Sharing how a partnership between procurement and operations reduced supply chain costs by 15%, benefiting the organisation as a whole.</p>
<h4>Key Takeaway: Building a Culture of Collaboration</h4>
<p>Cross-departmental collaboration is not just about solving immediate problems - it’s about fostering a culture where teams think holistically, innovate together, and work toward shared success. By implementing these strategies, organisations can unlock new levels of efficiency, creativity, and impact.</p>

<h2><span>It's all about the people</span></h2>
<p><span>So often when it comes to technology change, there's an assumption that everyone will adopt the new tools because, well, they have to. But it’s not that simple. People have ingrained ways of working, bureaucratic processes, and habits that can undermine the benefits you’re expecting to see.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may have control of your deadlines, budgets and business requirements. But what about the humans who are going to have to work in a new way? We need to focus on them too – and I promise you’re going to need more than a few emails and an instruction booklet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Executive Sponsorship: Beacons in Change</span></h4>
<p><span>You’ll struggle to get your transformation off the ground without Executives onboard. A visible, engaged sponsor builds momentum and credibility, aligning the change with your company’s big picture goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a real difference in tone when you have a visibly engaged sponsor – even with the most challenging of transformations. And the credibility they build has long-term benefits – because with every successful change, your organisation is better primed for the next one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Meet Your Change Ambassadors</span></h4>
<p><span><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon.png"" width=""263"" height=""263"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 263px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Think of change ambassadors as the bridge between the exec vision and the day-to-day reality. You can’t just talk to a few top folks and call it a day. You need to engage teams across the board and empower key people in each area to own the change.</span></p>
<p><span>These ambassadors are the change-makers in their teams. They spot those hidden processes and potential pitfalls that can delay or even derail a project and hurt the expected benefits. Plus, they’re always ready to give information, encouragement, and feedback to keep everything on track.</span></p>
<p><span>But these people don’t magically appear, already knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the change, and with plenty of capacity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve seen change networks fail fastest and hardest when projects don’t spend enough time and effort on their training, nurturing and support. Yes, this takes resources and budget, but it’s crucial if you want to hit those benefit figures.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<h4><span>Fear and Resistance: The Big Showstoppers<br></span></h4>
<p><span>Let’s face it, big change is scary. Especially when the change is outside of our control. And even the most innovative and forward-thinking people are going to be wondering:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Why do we need to change? (We’re busy enough as it is)</span></li>
<li><span>What does this really mean? (Is this just ‘code’ for cost-cutting and job losses?)</span></li>
<li><span>When will it all happen? (What deadlines will it clash with?)</span></li>
<li><span>How is it going to affect me? (What if it makes the job harder?)</span></li>
<li><span>Who’s going to help!? (I don’t know how to do this!)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Effective change management should address all these fears, helping minimise the risk of a project going off the tracks.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<h4><span>Tailored Training: Embracing Change with Confidence</span></h4>
<p><span>Even the most seasoned pros might feel a bit lost when they have to step into something new. Imagine going from being the expert everyone turns to, to suddenly having to learn new tricks. It's no wonder there's often some resistance.<br>Don’t think that just sending out instructions via email is going to cut it either. Adopting new methods requires an ongoing effort. It all starts with hands-on, practical training that's tailored to the team. Workshops or sandbox environments where you can get your hands dirty can really turbo-charge learning and boost confidence quickly.<br></span></p>
<p><span>It's important to see this as more than just a tick-box exercise. Sure, fitting in ample time for training within tight schedules is tough, and it does demand significant resources from both trainers and participants. But trust me, the long-term payoffs are worth it. Getting everyone prepped right from the start is crucial for lasting success.<br></span></p>
<h4><span>Making It Stick<br></span></h4>
<p><span><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon.png"" width=""289"" height=""289"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 289px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Transformation isn't a one-off event; it's an ongoing journey! And you’re working with one hand trapped behind your back if you aren’t making the company culture and systems work for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you're aiming to shake up work practices, you need to keep an eye on current team behaviors to prevent slipping back into old habits. How can you keep track of these, and what could help reinforce new processes?</span></p>
<p><span>Leaders need to recognise that real change takes time and effort from everyone, not just the project team and stakeholders. Encouraging participation and celebrating success can be a game-changer in embedding the current change and making your organisation receptive for more. This doesn’t have to be formal, or even financial – there’s a social currency we see when people and teams are recognised at work.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<h4><span>Wrapping It Up<br></span></h4>
<p><span>In short, you’ll fail to reach your transformation’s full potential without effective change management. Worse still, poorly managed change hits your bottom line because a disrupted, disengaged workforce is less productive.<br>Address the human side of change - fear, resistance, and the need for support - to ensure successful adoption of new tools or processes. Executive sponsors provide the vision and inspiration, while change ambassadors bridge the gap between strategy and execution. Tailored training empowers employees, and a culture of continuous improvement builds resilience for future success.</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, at the heart of every transformation are people. Prioritise change management, and you’ll unlock the full potential of your transformation initiatives, driving meaningful and sustainable success.&nbsp;<br></span></p>

As our <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Chief Technology Officer, Nick Seagrave</span>, emphasises, Apollo is not just another flashy tool - it’s a technical game-changer designed to empower contact centres with smarter data, more efficient processes, and real-time insights. Let’s cut through the hype and dive into why Apollo is truly revolutionising customer service technology.</p>
<!--more--><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Technology Behind Apollo: Bridging the Gap Between Data and Action</h2>
<p>Apollo’s core mission is simple yet powerful: to take the overwhelming noise of contact centre data and turn it into actionable, clear insights. Nick Seagrave, with his deep technical experience, describes this transformation as a direct response to a fundamental challenge: <em>“For years, the contact centre world has been working with fragmented, disconnected systems that don’t talk to each other. Agents are juggling multiple screens, disconnected databases, and often outdated processes.”</em></p>
<p>The complexity of these systems isn’t just an operational headache - it’s also a major barrier to delivering a seamless, positive customer experience. Apollo steps in to bridge this gap. By pulling all relevant data into a single platform, Apollo gives agents the ability to see the full context of a customer’s journey, rather than just isolated data points. As Nick puts it, <em>“Apollo makes it easy to understand the entire picture of an interaction, from the initial contact to the final resolution. It’s not just about tracking the usual metrics like average handle time or call transfers - it’s about understanding what’s happening throughout the entire journey.”</em></p>
<h2>Real-Time Data and AI: Making Every Contact Count</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Ai%20icon.png"" width=""274"" height=""274"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Ai icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 274px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Apollo leverages real-time data and artificial intelligence to drive meaningful change in contact centres. But while many solutions tout AI as the ultimate tool for transformation, Nick cautions that AI needs to be deployed with clear intent and precision<em>. “AI should never be used just for the sake of it,”</em> he notes. “<em>What Apollo brings to the table is AI that enhances decision-making and helps teams perform smarter, not harder.”</em></p>
<p>In practice, this means that Apollo’s AI is designed to process massive volumes of data instantly and extract actionable insights that help both agents and managers. With AI at the heart of the platform, Apollo delivers data-driven recommendations to guide decision-making and improve customer interactions. <em>“We’re talking about not just analysing what happened, but predicting what will happen,”</em> explains Nick. <em>“For example, Apollo can forecast which interactions are likely to escalate or which agents might need additional support based on real-time metrics.”</em></p>
<p>By integrating AI into the contact centre workflow, Apollo doesn’t just provide a reactive view of customer service - it offers proactive intelligence that drives performance improvement across the board.</p>
<h2>Scaling Efficiency with Automation: Smarter, Not Faster</h2>
<p>One of the most significant technical benefits Apollo brings to the table is its ability to automate key processes. But, as Nick emphasises, automation is not about speeding up service or cutting corners - it’s about improving efficiency and consistency while maintaining a high level of service. <em>“For Apollo, automation isn’t just about reducing handle times or pushing customers through a series of generic steps. It’s about automating repetitive tasks, allowing agents to focus on complex, value-driven interactions,” </em>says Nick.</p>
<p>Through sophisticated automation, Apollo is able to take the burden off agents by automating tasks like basic queries, information gathering, and process management. For instance, instead of agents manually searching through multiple systems to gather information, Apollo can automate this process, instantly pulling up relevant data from different systems and presenting it to the agent in a unified view. <em>“This isn’t just convenience - it’s about streamlining the process so that agents can focus on the real work: solving problems and providing great service,” </em>Nick explains.</p>
<p>This approach ensures that Apollo doesn’t just speed up processes - it intelligently optimises them, making contact centres more agile and responsive without sacrificing quality.</p>
<h2>Data Security: Protecting What Matters</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Manage%20icon.png"" width=""247"" height=""247"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Manage icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 247px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">As with any cutting-edge technology, security is a top priority. When it comes to customer interactions, the privacy of both the business and the customer is non-negotiable. Nick makes it clear that Apollo’s security architecture is designed with the highest standards in mind. <em>“We’ve designed Apollo with the strongest data security protocols in place,”</em> he asserts. <em>“Our platform ensures that all customer data stays within your organisation’s environment - it's secure, private, and fully under your control.”</em></p>
<p>Nick’s focus on security is particularly important as businesses look to integrate more advanced technologies like AI into their customer service operations. <em>“As much as AI and real-time data are powerful, they also come with responsibility,”</em> he says. Apollo is built to ensure that sensitive data is handled with the utmost care, adhering to privacy regulations and giving businesses full visibility into how data is used.</p>
<h2>Insights That Matter: From Analytics to Action</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo/Apollo%20in%20Action%20-%20Scoring%20Dash_v1.png"" width=""699"" height=""389"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Dashboard view of Apollo with data representation"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 699px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<p>Another technical advantage of Apollo lies in its ability to generate insights that go beyond basic reporting. <em>“One of the key issues in many contact centres is the gap between data and actionable insights,” </em>explains Nick. <em>“A lot of data is collected, but businesses struggle to translate that into something meaningful. Apollo solves this by not only analysing data but by providing clear, prescriptive actions.”</em></p>
<p>Apollo’s analytics engine doesn’t just churn out numbers - it offers recommendations. These actionable insights help contact centre managers understand patterns, optimise staffing, improve training, and, most importantly, enhance the customer experience. <em>“With Apollo, you're not just seeing data about performance. You’re seeing exactly what’s going well, where the bottlenecks are, and where you can improve,”</em> Nick adds.</p>
<p>These insights are made even more powerful through Apollo’s ability to track the entire customer journey, from the initial contact to final resolution. This comprehensive view allows businesses to fine-tune their processes, improve agent performance, and better anticipate customer needs.</p>
<h2>Why Apollo Isn’t Just Another “CX Tool”</h2>
<p>The real value of Apollo, according to Nick, lies in its ability to combine all these technological advances into one cohesive solution. <em>“It’s not about adding another tool to your stack - it’s about integrating everything you need into one unified platform,”</em> Nick states. By combining real-time data processing, AI-driven insights, automation, and deep analytics, Apollo offers a holistic solution that helps contact centres perform better across the board.</p>
<p>It’s also about ensuring that the technology doesn’t overshadow the human experience. As Nick puts it, <em>“Apollo is designed to enhance the capabilities of both agents and managers, not replace them. The goal is to give them the tools they need to do their jobs more effectively, not to take over.”</em> With this focus on empowering people through technology, Apollo is able to make a tangible impact on customer experience without losing sight of what truly matters - the people on the other side of the conversation.</p>
<h2>Apollo as the Next-Generation Solution for Contact Centres</h2>
<p>Apollo stands apart as a solution that genuinely delivers. With its ability to bring data into a single view, automate routine tasks, and deliver real-time insights, Apollo is a technical powerhouse that is reshaping the future of customer service. <em>“Apollo is more than just a tool - it’s a game-changer,”</em> Nick concludes. <em>“It combines the best of technology with the human side of customer service, ensuring that every contact counts.”</em></p>
<p>In a world that increasingly relies on technology, Apollo represents the perfect intersection of human understanding and technical innovation. With Apollo, contact centres are no longer just responding to customer enquiries - they’re proactively driving customer satisfaction and improving performance across the board. This isn’t just another CX solution. It’s a revolution in how businesses connect with their customers, powered by the smart use of technology that’s built to last.</p>

<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon.png"" width=""186"" height=""186"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 186px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">In the ever-changing CX landscape, one thing is certain: businesses of all sizes must innovate to stay relevant. At CloudInteract, we have a simple philosophy - there’s no excuse for bad customer service. This principle underpins everything we do, driving us to create solutions that empower businesses to reimagine how they interact with their customers.</p>
<p>As a co-founder of CloudInteract, I’ve seen firsthand how even the smallest, digital-first startups can make waves in an industry often dominated by legacy providers. Founded in 2023 with a mission to transform customer experience, our journey began with a vision to help organisations unlock the power of their customer data, fostering meaningful, actionable insights. With Apollo, our cutting-edge data intelligence platform, we’re proving that innovation isn’t just for the tech giants - it’s for the disruptors who are willing to challenge the status quo.</p>
<h4>The Risk of Rushing Innovation</h4>
<p>In our industry, there’s a rush to deploy technologies like conversational AI, often driven by fear of falling behind. Unfortunately, many organisations skip the critical foundational steps, diving headfirst into advanced AI solutions without fully understanding their capabilities - or limitations. The result? Frustration, disillusionment, and wasted resources.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we take a different approach. Innovation isn’t about moving fast for the sake of it; it’s about moving smart. That’s why we developed Apollo - a solution designed to help businesses take a measured, step-by-step approach to modernising their contact centres. With Apollo, we focus on enhancing data clarity, enabling companies to categorise and analyse customer interactions with precision. This isn’t just about improving operational efficiency; it’s about uncovering the stories hidden in customer interactions and using those insights to drive meaningful change.</p>
<h4>Innovation in Action</h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo/Cloud%20Interact%20-%20Apollo%20Logo%20Full%20Colour.png"" width=""501"" height=""132"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Cloud Interact - Apollo Logo Full Colour"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 501px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Let me give you an example of how Apollo transforms customer experience. Imagine a company struggling to understand why its Net Promoter Score (NPS) is slipping. With Apollo, they can transcribe and categorise every customer interaction, revealing patterns and trends that were previously invisible. Perhaps customers are consistently calling about the same unresolved issue, or maybe certain pain points are being overlooked by agents. By highlighting these insights, Apollo empowers businesses to realign their strategies, train their teams, and improve service delivery - all while building trust with their customers.</p>
<p><a href=""/apollo-making-every-contact-count"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Find out more about Apollo&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>But Apollo doesn’t stop at analysis. Its AI capabilities enable organisations to automate routine tasks, freeing up human agents to focus on complex customer needs. This creates a powerful feedback loop: better data leads to better decisions, which leads to better customer outcomes. Ultimately, Apollo helps businesses achieve what every CX leader strives for - improved NPS and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores, without the frustration and disappointment that often accompany rushed AI deployments.</p>
<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
<p>The future of CX innovation is both exciting and challenging. As AI evolves, we’ll see technologies capable of real-time customer interaction, providing immediate resolutions to queries and anticipating customer needs before they’re even voiced. But these advancements will only succeed if businesses adopt them responsibly, with a clear focus on the customer.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we’re not just building products; we’re building partnerships. Apollo embodies our commitment to helping organisations navigate the complexities of modern CX, ensuring that every step of the journey is grounded in insights, empathy, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Whether you’re a startup or an enterprise, innovation is within your reach - if you’re willing to embrace it thoughtfully.</p>

","2024-12-17 14:42:55","2025-01-27 15:12:22","<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that delivering seamless customer experiences is a key challenge for many organisations. For businesses using Amazon Connect, offering quick and easy connections through chat widgets is a powerful first step. By enabling customers to engage in meaningful conversations with bots that understand their needs, organisations can quickly route customers to the right agents, improving efficiency and response times.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">However, sometimes, chat alone isn't enough. While text can provide clarity, there are moments when a picture - or even better, a video - speaks louder than words. In certain industries, such as private banking or healthcare, visual communication can significantly improve service quality, reduce misunderstandings, and allow agents to better assist customers by observing non-verbal cues.</p>
<p>Despite the clear benefits of video, many businesses are reluctant to introduce new platforms, especially when they’ve already invested in a trusted tool like Microsoft Teams for internal communications. The challenge is clear: how can we offer the advantages of video without disrupting the flow of existing communications?</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we know that juggling multiple tools can overwhelm both IT teams and agents. In fact, a recent survey found that over 55% of contact centre leaders attribute agent attrition to difficulties with managing multiple tools. That’s why we’ve found a way to <a href=""/resource-hub/combining-amazon-connect-and-microsoft-teams-video-to-enhance-customer-experience"" rel=""noopener"">integrate Amazon Connect with Microsoft Teams</a> in a way that brings the best of both worlds together - without adding unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h4><strong>Combining Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams: A Solution You Can Trust</strong></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Manage%20icon-100.jpg"" width=""298"" height=""298"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Manage icon-100"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 298px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">With years of experience delivering tailored solutions for complex customer interactions, CloudInteract has mastered the art of blending Amazon Connect’s robust chat functionality with the power of Microsoft Teams for voice and video calls. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers can continue to start conversations through Amazon Connect's chat widget, engaging with bots to clarify their needs before being routed to the right agent.</li>
<li>For many interactions, chat alone is sufficient. However, when a more personal or detailed discussion is needed, agents can easily escalate the conversation to voice or video without leaving their familiar interface.</li>
<li>The integration allows both customer and agent to join a video call through their browser - no apps, plugins, or downloads necessary - using Microsoft Teams. And because the meeting is hosted on your Microsoft Teams tenant, everything remains secure and compliant, in line with your internal policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>For organisations that don’t use Microsoft Teams, we offer alternatives like Azure Communication Services, which provide secure, scalable video solutions within the Microsoft Azure environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Real-World Example: Improving Customer Experience with Video</strong></h4>
<p>Take the example of a customer seeking mortgage advice. After receiving a quotation via email, they have follow-up questions that could take considerable time to address through chat. With CloudInteract’s solution, the advisor can seamlessly switch from chat to a video call, offering a much richer and clearer explanation of the mortgage details.</p>
<p>The advisor clicks a button in Amazon Connect to generate a Teams meeting, and a link is sent to the customer to join the call. The advisor can then share their screen, walk the customer through the document, and resolve any questions in real-time. The entire conversation is automatically logged in Amazon Connect, ensuring valuable insights are preserved for future reference.</p>
<h4><strong>Why Choose CloudInteract’s Solution?</strong></h4>
<p>CloudInteract’s deep understanding of both Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams ensures that your organisation can provide a richer, more effective customer experience. Here’s what makes our solution stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Seamless Communication</strong>:</span> Customers can easily transition from chat to voice or video without switching platforms, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted service.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Simplicity</strong>:</span> No plugins or extra software are required - everything works on modern browsers, with no need for customers to download additional apps.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>:</span> Whether you're using Microsoft Teams or Azure Communication Services, all communications are secured under your organisation’s existing infrastructure and compliance standards.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Customer-Centric Focus</strong>:</span> We design solutions that put customer experience at the heart of the process, ensuring agents have the tools they need to provide the best possible service.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Value for Your Organisation and Customers</strong></h4>
<p>By combining Amazon Connect with Microsoft Teams, CloudInteract helps organisations deliver richer, more personalised customer interactions. The solution is easy to implement, integrates seamlessly with your existing systems, and provides agents with the flexibility to switch between chat, voice, and video with just a click.</p>
<p>Whether you're in private banking, healthcare, or any other sector where face-to-face communication adds value, CloudInteract’s expertise ensures that your team is always equipped to deliver the highest level of service.</p>

","2024-12-20 16:08:59","2025-01-24 10:39:06","<p><em>In a world where technology often feels detached from human emotion, there is a solution that bridges this gap - Apollo. As our Change Director, Eliza Taylor, explains, Apollo isn’t just about cutting-edge technology or automation; it’s about transforming the human experience. Whether it’s helping agents do their jobs more efficiently or ensuring customers feel heard, Apollo is reshaping the customer experience landscape with a focus on people-first solutions. Here’s Eliza’s take on how Apollo empowers both businesses and individuals.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<h2>The Intersection of Technology and Human Experience: Why Every Contact Counts</h2>
<p>It’s easy to forget that customer service isn’t just about algorithms, dashboards, and data points - it’s about people. It’s about understanding their frustrations, acknowledging their needs, and responding with empathy. As Eliza Taylor, our Change Director, puts it, <em>“Technology alone won’t transform customer service. It’s about people, processes, and technology coming together to create an experience that’s seamless, meaningful, and - above all - human.”</em> With this philosophy at the core, Apollo isn’t just another tool for businesses - it’s a transformative solution that enhances both the human and technological sides of the contact centre experience.</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Apollo/Cloud%20Interact%20-%20Apollo%20Logo%20Full%20Colour.png"" width=""600"" height=""158"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Cloud Interact - Apollo Logo Full Colour"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 600px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">In this blog, we’ll explore how Apollo uniquely combines cutting-edge technology with the human element of customer service, providing actionable insights that not only optimise business operations but also improve agent and customer experiences. By bridging the gap between technology and human interaction, Apollo ensures that every contact matters, creating lasting value for customers, agents, and businesses alike.</p>
<h2>The Problem: A Whirlwind of Noise and Data</h2>
<p>Anyone who’s ever worked in a contact centre knows the chaos that comes with trying to manage customer service at scale. The sheer volume of customer requests, data, and demands can feel overwhelming. As Eliza points out, contact centres often resemble a “whirlwind of noise” where businesses are bombarded with a constant stream of data that doesn’t always paint a clear picture. <em>“Businesses are making decisions based on what they have, but they don’t have the complete picture. There’s a huge chunk of information about the customer’s journey that’s missing,”</em> Eliza explains.</p>
<p>This fragmented view of customer service often leads to decisions that don’t address the root causes of dissatisfaction. For example, contact centres might track metrics like average handle time or wait times, but these don’t fully capture the customer's experience. Did the customer spend 15 minutes searching for information on your website before calling in? Did they have to go through multiple systems and touchpoints before reaching the right person? These are critical insights that traditional systems often miss, leaving agents and managers working in the dark.</p>
<p>Apollo changes this by offering a comprehensive view of the entire customer journey - across all channels and touchpoints. As Eliza says, <em>“It’s about having the full picture. Apollo doesn’t just provide data about how long customers are on the phone or how many times they’ve been transferred. It helps businesses understand the complete context of each interaction.”</em> With Apollo, contact centres can connect the dots between customer behaviours, pain points, and the systems they’re using, ultimately enabling businesses to make more informed decisions.</p>
<h2>The Human Impact: Empowering Agents and Improving Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Making-Every-Moment-Count-Icon.png"" width=""242"" height=""242"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Making-Every-Moment-Count-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 242px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">One of the most powerful aspects of Apollo is its ability to empower contact centre agents. <em>“Agents are at the forefront of customer interactions, and they deserve better tools to do their jobs effectively,”</em> Eliza says. In many cases, agents are working with outdated or fragmented systems that make their jobs more difficult. They’re constantly jumping between screens, entering data into multiple systems, and dealing with disjointed workflows. This not only slows down the process but also leads to frustration - both for the agent and the customer.</p>
<p>Apollo changes this by streamlining data and providing agents with real-time insights into each customer interaction. <em>“Apollo brings all the data into one view,”</em> explains Eliza. <em>“It eliminates the need for agents to dig through different systems and focus on solving the problem at hand.”</em> This results in faster response times, more informed decisions, and, ultimately, happier customers. It also reduces agent burnout, as they no longer have to struggle with clunky, outdated systems.</p>
<p>But Apollo doesn’t just help agents perform better - it also ensures that customers receive a more personalised experience. By providing agents with key insights into the customer’s journey, Apollo enables them to tailor their responses based on the customer’s unique needs. <em>“Customers don’t want to feel like just another number,”</em> Eliza explains. <em>“They want to feel heard and understood. With Apollo, agents can engage with customers in a more empathetic, meaningful way.”</em></p>
<h2>Data-Driven Insights: Turning Information Into Action</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Data%20icon.png"" width=""251"" height=""251"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 251px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">While it’s clear that Apollo improves the human side of customer service, its true value lies in its ability to turn data into actionable insights. Apollo doesn’t just collect information - it analyses it and presents businesses with clear, data-driven recommendations. This makes it easier for managers and executives to understand what’s working, what’s not, and where improvements are needed.</p>
<p>Eliza stresses that many businesses struggle with interpreting data: <em>“Leaders are often making decisions without the full picture. They might know how many calls their agents are taking or how long customers are waiting, but they don’t have the insights to understand what’s actually happening in their contact centre.”</em> Apollo solves this by providing deep insights into customer behaviour, agent performance, and system efficiency.</p>
<p>These insights are especially valuable when it comes to identifying trends, pain points, and areas for improvement. <em>“It’s not just about tracking metrics like average handle time,”</em> Eliza says. <em>“It’s about understanding why customers are calling, what they’re looking for, and how agents can better meet those needs.”</em> By providing this level of detail, Apollo allows businesses to make data-driven decisions that improve customer service and reduce inefficiencies.</p>
<h2>Making Every Contact Count: The Power of Personalisation</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon.png"" width=""257"" height=""257"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Empowering-Your-Team-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 257px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">At the heart of Apollo’s design is the belief that every contact should count. Whether it’s a quick query or a complex issue, every interaction is an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between a business and its customers. Apollo ensures that businesses can make the most of every contact by providing agents with the right information at the right time. This leads to more meaningful conversations, faster resolutions, and, ultimately, higher customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>As Eliza explains, <em>“We’re not just focusing on reducing handle time or speeding up processes. We’re focused on making every customer interaction valuable. That means understanding the full context of the customer’s journey and providing them with personalised service that makes them feel heard and cared for.”</em></p>
<p>Apollo enables this level of personalisation by collecting and analysing data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring that every agent has access to a complete history of the customer’s interactions. This not only makes the service more efficient but also allows businesses to deliver a higher level of empathy and understanding. It’s this personalised, human approach that sets Apollo apart from other customer service solutions.</p>
<h2>The Future of Customer Experience: A More Human-Centred Approach</h2>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon.png"" width=""256"" height=""256"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Driving-Business-Success-Icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 256px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">As we look to the future of customer service, it’s clear that technology will play an increasingly important role. But as Eliza points out, <em>“Technology is just the enabler. The real transformation happens when businesses put people at the centre of everything they do.”</em> Apollo is leading the way in this shift by providing businesses with the tools they need to deliver a more human-centred customer experience.</p>
<p>Apollo’s ability to combine the power of data with the importance of human empathy makes it a game-changer for contact centres. By improving agent performance, enhancing customer satisfaction, and providing clear insights into customer behaviour, Apollo is helping businesses make every contact count. And as Eliza so aptly puts it, <em>“It’s not just about answering questions - it’s about making connections that last.”</em> Apollo is reshaping the way we think about customer service, turning every interaction into an opportunity to build stronger, more meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Apollo is not just another tool in the contact centre’s tech stack; it’s a solution that transforms the entire customer experience by putting people at the heart of the process. By empowering agents, providing real-time insights, and offering personalised service, Apollo ensures that every interaction counts. As Eliza so eloquently explains, <em>“Transformation isn’t just about the technology - it’s about making sure the technology supports the people who are using it.”</em></p>
<p>In the end, Apollo isn’t just changing the way businesses interact with their customers; it’s redefining what great customer service looks like in the 21st century. With Apollo, every contact counts - not just for the business, but for the people behind every call. As Eliza says, it’s about creating meaningful connections that will last long after the interaction ends. Apollo isn’t just transforming customer service; it’s transforming the way we engage with one another.</p>

<p>Are you ready to dive headfirst into the future of customer experience? In the latest episode of the ACP podcast, host Tom Morgan is joined by co-host Alex Baker and special guests Eliza Taylor (Change Director at CloudInteract) and Nick Seagrave (CTO at CloudInteract). Together, they discuss how technology, people, and smart strategies are reshaping the way contact centres operate - and why now is the perfect time to embrace change.</p>
<p>{{cta('199759018190','justifycenter')}}</p>
<h4>Why 2025 Is a Watershed Moment</h4>
<p>With customer expectations shifting faster than ever, businesses can no longer rely on the same outdated processes and technology they used five or ten years ago. As Tom and his guests point out, the traditional “press 1 for sales, press 2 for service” IVR isn’t cutting it anymore. If your contact centre still feels clunky, you risk losing customers who have grown used to seamless, intuitive experiences from the likes of Amazon, streaming services, or online banks.</p>
<h4>The Key Ingredient: Human-Centric Change</h4>
<p>While technology is crucial, Eliza Taylor emphasises that organisations must also focus on the human side of transformation. Employees are not automatically excited by new systems - many are wary of losing the expertise they’ve built with current, familiar tools. This is where the concept of negativity bias comes into play: people naturally focus on potential threats and downsides instead of benefits. According to Eliza, leaders need to address employees’ fears early and often, showing empathy and providing clear training and support. Successful change management starts with understanding that employees are your first adopters. If they don’t embrace the new system, you can kiss those big ROI figures goodbye.</p>
<h4>Meet Apollo: A Game-Changer from CloudInteract</h4>
<p>Want to know how companies like CloudInteract are enabling real, data-driven change? Enter Apollo, the new solution introduced by the team. As Nick Seagrave explains, it’s all about turning mountains of call data into actionable insights. Many contact centres record thousands of calls every day, but very few have the resources or technology to analyse them at scale. That’s exactly what Apollo does: it harnesses cloud-based AI to transcribe calls, measure sentiment, detect trends, and categorize interactions far more accurately than humans ever could.<br><br>Once organisations understand what customers are really talking about - and how agents handle those queries - they can start building self-service portals, chatbots, and even specialised training programmes to address the most common issues. For example, if Apollo’s data shows that 30% of your customers are calling about billing questions, you might design a user-friendly billing bot. Not only does this reduce call volume (cutting costs), but it also shortens wait times for complex inquiries that require a human touch.</p>
<h4>From Insight to Action</h4>
<p>Of course, raw data is only part of the story. What truly matters is how companies use these insights to deliver better customer and employee experiences. Alex Baker points out that the flexibility of solutions like Apollo means you can refine precisely what you’re looking for - whether it’s reducing after-call work for agents or uncovering new product-feedback trends. The result is a smoother, more personalised interaction for your customers, and a more efficient, streamlined workday for your agents.</p>
<h4>Ready to Explore the Future?</h4>
<p>If your organisation is grappling with outdated processes, high call volumes, or simply struggling to meet sky-high customer expectations, tune in to this special podcast episode. You’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the balancing act between technology and the human side of change. You’ll also learn why the journey toward better customer experience starts by analysing what’s really going on in your contact center - and how a tool like Apollo can reveal insights you never knew were hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>Don’t miss out on this exciting glimpse into the future of customer service.</p>

<p>In the latest episode of our podcast, Tom and Alex dive into the newest features Amazon Connect offers for enhancing contact centre efficiency and security: screen recording, screen sharing, and potential AI integration.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of what was discussed:</p>
<h4><strong>An Introduction to Screen Recording in Amazon Connect</strong></h4>
<p>The episode kicks off with an introduction to Amazon Connect’s screen recording capability, a powerful new feature designed to capture agents' screen activity during customer interactions. This isn’t an automatic feature it requires users to opt in, ensuring companies actively decide when and how to use it.</p>
<h4><strong>Functionality and Use Cases: A Tool for Coaching and Quality Monitoring</strong></h4>
<p>The screen recording feature is versatile, capturing all activities across agents' screens while they’re engaged with customers. Whether your agents work with a single screen or multiple monitors, the feature records every interaction. This functionality opens doors to a range of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coaching and Development:</strong> Managers can review recordings to provide personalised feedback, allowing agents to refine their approach.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Monitoring:</strong> Supervisors can observe workflows and spot opportunities for process improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Insights:</strong> By understanding how agents navigate systems, organisations can identify ways to simplify tasks and increase productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The Addition of Screen Sharing: More Support for Agents and Customers</strong></h4>
<p>Separate from screen recording, Amazon Connect’s new screen sharing feature allows agents to share their screen with customers during chats or voice sessions. This tool is a significant support asset, enabling agents to guide customers through complex issues visually. It’s an exciting addition to Amazon Connect’s suite, adding a new layer of interactivity and customer support.</p>
<h4><strong>Security and Compliance: Keeping Sensitive Information Safe</strong></h4>
<p>With the potential for sensitive information to be captured, security and compliance are critical considerations. The episode highlighted how Amazon Connect stores screen recordings in encrypted MP4 files within Amazon S3, a secure storage service. To ensure compliance, it’s essential to control access to these recordings carefully, balancing accessibility for review with stringent security measures.</p>
<h4><strong>Technical Requirements: Preparing for Implementation</strong></h4>
<p>A few technical considerations come with enabling the screen recording feature. For instance, client-side software must be installed on agents' computers, where it runs silently in the background. Given its requirements on hardware and network resources, IT teams need to assess and prepare accordingly. Proactive planning will minimise disruptions and optimise the feature’s performance.</p>
<h4><strong>Exploring Use Cases and Benefits</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process Optimisation:</strong> By studying screen recordings, managers can streamline workflows to reduce bottlenecks and improve agent efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Screen recordings provide valuable data for fraud investigations, offering visual records of customer interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> When agents encounter technical issues, screen recordings help identify exactly what happened, speeding up resolution times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selective recording options also help manage storage and network impact, allowing for customised and efficient implementation.</p>
<h4><strong>Legal Considerations: Navigating Regulatory Landscapes</strong></h4>
<p>Data collection and monitoring regulations vary across countries, and the episode emphasised the need to navigate legal considerations carefully. Ensuring that your use of screen recording aligns with local data protection laws is paramount to avoid compliance pitfalls.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Takeaways and Considerations for Implementation</strong></h4>
<p>As this feature suite in Amazon Connect evolves, organizations have an opportunity to enhance their contact centre performance meaningfully. Here are a few considerations for those ready to explore screen recording for Amazon Connect:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define Clear Goals:</strong> Know what you want to achieve with screen recording, whether it’s improving quality monitoring, boosting agent productivity, or enhancing security.</li>
<li><strong>Balance Security with Accessibility:</strong> Set up security protocols to protect sensitive information without limiting necessary access for quality reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Assess Technical Readiness:</strong> Collaborate with IT teams to ensure the infrastructure supports smooth operation and avoids unnecessary slowdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Compliant:</strong> Keep regulatory compliance top of mind, especially when handling customer data across international boundaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>This episode is packed with insights for anyone looking to enhance their Amazon Connect experience with these powerful new tools. Listen in to learn how to unlock these capabilities, helping your contact centre stay ahead in delivering exceptional customer experience.</p>

<p>At CloudInteract, we’re all about making things better - for you, your customers, and your users. Which makes us even more excited to share some news that reflects just that. We’ve officially achieved<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Amazon Advanced Partner Status</strong>, and the best part? We did it in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>only five months</strong>. It’s not just a badge - it’s proof of what we can achieve when we work together toward something truly transformational.</p>
<p>So, what does that really mean for you?</p>
<p>Becoming an Amazon Advanced Partner usually takes companies quite a bit longer, but we accelerated the journey because we know how to bring our A-game to every project. It’s not just about knowing technology - it’s about using it to make real, meaningful change. And that’s what this recognition is all about. We’ve demonstrated we can create impact, quickly and effectively, helping businesses transform their customer experiences for the better.</p>
<p>What’s more, we now have<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>7 Amazon Connect Ambassadors</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>- more than any other UK partner. These aren’t just experts; they’re people who genuinely understand how to make technology work for you, so you can focus on what really matters: creating connections that leave lasting impressions.</p>
<p>For us, this isn’t just about achieving a milestone. It’s about creating real value. Reaching Amazon Advanced Partner Status gives us even more tools and resources to help you, to bring that “better” we talk about to life. Better customer interactions. Better processes. Better support.</p>

<p>‍<strong>20 SEPTEMBER, 2024:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=""https://www.cloudinteract.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CloudInteract</a>, a rapidly growing, UK-based provider of customer experience (CX) platforms, announces a range of senior hires to support its UK growth plans and expansion into the US market.</p>
<p>Founded by customer workplace communications experts, Nick Seagrave and Simon Leyland, CloudInteract was launched in 2023 and provides customers, including education provider, Pearson, life sciences enterprises, and online consumer services, such as Swoop, with innovative CX software, as well as supporting industry partners, such as Amazon Web Services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>CloudInteract works with businesses to help unlock data insights and enable smarter communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the delivery of AI-driven platforms and omni-channel systems, CloudInteract empowers companies to scale and continuously adapt to their evolving customer service needs.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Leyland</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>CEO</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Co-founder</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>CloudInteract</strong>, explains, “CloudInteract was born out of Nick’s and my mission to reimagine customer experience, by making contact centre interactions better for both customers and users alike. We understand that in a world full of technology providers, the difference lies in how that technology is used to transform real-world experiences.”</p>
<p>The growth achieved by CloudInteract in under two years has been attributed to the company’s ability to empower businesses to reimagine and transform customer interactions.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen tremendous growth in a short period because the businesses we work with recognise the importance of enhancing customer interactions to drive tangible value,” continued<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Simon</strong>.</p>
<p>In support of its UK growth plans and expansion of its US presence, CloutInteract has onboarded new talent to its now 50% female senior leadership team.</p>
<p>The CX platform provider recently welcomed Louise Mahrra as Marketing Director, Nancy Van Delist as Head of Business, North America and Julian Degg as UK Head of Business Development. They will work alongside Change Director, Eliza Taylor and co-founders, Chief Technology Officer, Nick Seagrave and CEO Simon Leyland.</p>
<p>As CloudInteract expands its operations and brings in new talent to support strategic growth in an industry predicted to mature to over<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/customer-service-software-market"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">USD 22 billion</a><span>&nbsp;</span>by 2030, the company’s founders and newly appointed senior team are firmly fixated on helping businesses unlock the full potential of their customer experience platforms by turning every interaction into a competitive advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>added, “Our growth is fuelled by a dedication to reimagining what customer experience can be. By doubling down on our investment in people, partnerships, and platforms, we’re positioning CloudInteract as the go-to partner for businesses that want to unlock the power of AI, data, and communication to transform their customer interactions.”</p>
<p>“CloudInteract has set an ambitious growth target of achieving £5m in revenue by March 2026, having already exceeded mid-year revenue growth in the first half of 2024. The company is also on track to double its headcount by March 2026, with an additional 25 hires planned across both the UK and US to support continued expansion and customer success,” concluded<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Simon</strong>.</p>

","2024-12-18 10:59:23","2024-12-18 15:07:41","<p>When you imagine a modern contact centre, you might think of a sophisticated environment handling a multitude of interaction channels - voice calls, live chat, email, SMS, and social messaging - streamlining the path between customers and the help they need. Despite these advances, many organisations still rely on traditional, manual processes to configure and manage these infrastructures. The result? Excessive operational overheads, limited scalability, and a slower response to changing customer needs.</p>
<!--more--><p><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>At CloudInteract</strong></span>, we believe there’s a smarter way. Enter “Contact Centre as Code” (CCaC) - an approach that transforms how businesses design, deploy, and optimise their customer engagement platforms. By blending the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with next-generation contact centre solutions, CCaC empowers teams to harness automation, drive consistency, and scale seamlessly. It’s a paradigm shift from painstaking manual adjustments to code-driven orchestration, turning weeks of effort into minutes and unlocking agility at every level.</p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 22px;""><span style=""color: #f40876;"">What is Contact Centre as Code?</span></h4>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Icons/Data%20icon.png"" width=""173"" height=""173"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 173px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;"">CCaC involves defining and managing every aspect of your contact centre - telephony, messaging channels, routing logic, IVR menus, and more - through codified templates. In other words, you move from slow, reactive, and error-prone manual changes to a system where adjustments, enhancements, and expansions are handled at the speed of modern business. By doing so, you not only gain control and transparency but also position your organisation to adapt fluidly in response to evolving demands.</p>
<h4>Key Principles of CCaC</h4>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Automated Configuration:</strong></span><br>Just as IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible let IT teams effortlessly spin up servers and networks, CCaC empowers contact centre managers to create, modify, and deploy complex customer engagement environments through code. <strong>CloudInteract’s</strong> specialists guide organisations in codifying everything from agent skill groups to chatbot interactions, ensuring automated, consistent rollouts every time.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong></span><br>Demand fluctuates. Whether it’s a holiday season or a product launch, CCaC makes scaling your contact centre capacity as simple as editing a configuration file. With the right code-based approach - and <strong>CloudInteract’s</strong> strategic advice - you can provision additional queues, integrate new channels (like SMS or social messaging), or quickly revert to baseline, all without missing a beat.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Consistency Through Version Control:</strong></span><br>By maintaining all configurations in code repositories like Git, your contact centre setup gains a “single source of truth.” Audit trails become clearer, rollbacks are straightforward, and comparing test versus production environments is seamless. <strong>CloudInteract</strong> helps organisations establish these robust governance practices, maintaining reliability and transparency throughout the contact centre ecosystem.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Rapid Deployment and Updates:</strong></span><br>New business rules, compliance requirements, or customer preferences won’t wait. CCaC lets you respond swiftly - just update your code, validate it, and deploy in minutes. This agility ensures your customers receive prompt, tailored support, and with <strong>CloudInteract</strong> as your partner, changes are both rapid and expertly managed.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:</strong></span><br>In today’s DevOps landscape, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ensures rapid, reliable feature releases. CCaC seamlessly fits into this model. <strong>CloudInteract</strong> helps organisations integrate their contact centre configurations with existing CI/CD workflows, so your engagement infrastructure evolves at the speed of software - securely, predictably, and with minimal downtime.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Centralised Multi-Channel Management:</strong></span><br>Modern customers bounce between channels - phone, chat, social, email - with ease. CCaC centralises these channels into a unified codebase, ensuring a consistent, personalised experience. By working with <strong>CloudInteract’s</strong> contact centre engineering experts, you’ll ensure that your customers receive cohesive service, no matter where or how they reach out.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Effortless Disaster Recovery and Replication:</strong></span><br>Downtime is costly. With CCaC, replicating environments in new data centres or cloud regions is as easy as running a script. <strong>CloudInteract</strong> enables businesses to define robust disaster recovery strategies in code, minimising downtime, maintaining service continuity, and protecting customer relationships.</li>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Launching a New Service Quickly:</strong></span><br>Introducing a new product line? With CCaC and <strong>CloudInteract’s</strong> specialised guidance, you can provision telephony routes, IVR menus, CRM integrations, and agent workflows in hours instead of weeks.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Responding to Seasonal Demand:</strong></span><br>For retailers facing holiday rushes or annual sales peaks, CCaC allows quick, code-driven adjustments to handle increased contact volumes - then roll back to normal settings later. This ensures consistently positive customer experiences and maximises loyalty, a strategic advantage that <strong>CloudInteract</strong> helps organisations leverage fully.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Global Consistency with Local Adaptations:</strong></span><br>Operating globally? CCaC enables multinational enterprises to roll out uniform configurations across regions while tailoring local elements - like language, IVR prompts, or routing rules - to suit local markets. <strong>CloudInteract</strong> ensures these adaptations align with your global brand standards and operational goals.</li>

<h4><strong>The Future of Efficient Customer Engagement</strong></h4>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>We see many organisations who are using Amazon Connect to provide a streamlined way for customers to quickly connect with agents. By deploying a chat widget to their website, companies can offer a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>rich bot experience</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that can be used to understand the issue that needs resolving, before routing to an appropriate person or team.</p>
<p>Once there though, conversation is limited to chat, which can be limiting in some cases. If a picture speaks a thousand words, how much more useful would a short video call be? In many sectors, being able to show the issue can save lots of typing and potential confusion. In other sectors it can be used to provide an enhanced level of service and care, for example in private banking or high-wealth appointments. In health and social care, it can provide clinical and support staff valuable additional information and non-verbal cues.</p>
<p>However, IT teams are clear that they don't want to introduce another communications platform. Many organisations have chosen Microsoft Teams as their communication vendor of choice and would prefer that all voice and video workloads stay on a single platform. They trust the security and compliance credentials that Microsoft brings, and managing a single platform for communication means easier networking configuration and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Agents (and those in the organisation who aren't agents but who occasionally take calls from customers)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>don't want to manage multiple tools</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>either.</p>
<p>In a 2022 survey, over 55% of contact centre leaders believe agent attrition is due to difficulties with tools and software.<br>(ref:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://assets.ringcentral.com/us/ebook/agent-experience-trends.pdf"">https://assets.ringcentral.com/us/ebook/agent-experience-trends.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>Anyone who has been on a call using one platform, whilst receiving an incoming call from another, knows how distracting and stressful this can be.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Combing Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>We believe that the solution to this challenge is to combine both Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams in a way that has not previously been done.</p>
<p>Customers continue to use Amazon Connect and the chat widget to start a chat-based conversation with a bot, before being connected with the appropriate agent.</p>
<p>Agents continue to use Amazon Connect to chat with a customer, and for many interactions a chat-only experience will be good enough.</p>
<p>However, agents can at any time choose to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>escalate the conversation to voice &amp; video</strong>. Both customer and agent can join the call using browser-based technologies, with no applications or plugins to install. They can choose to start voice, video and screen-sharing with a simple joining link.</p>
<p>The meeting is hosted using Microsoft Teams technology on the organisation's tenant, meaning it is secured and managed alongside all other Teams meetings on the tenant.</p>
<p>For organisations that do not have Microsoft Teams but are looking for a secure, stable and scalable video platform, an alternative is to use Azure Communication Services, ensuring the video call remains within the organisation’s Microsoft Azure tenant and is under their control.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h4>Example: Secure Video for Deeper Customer Interaction</h4>
<p>An area where video can quickly and efficiently help resolve questions is professional guidance, such as mortgage advice.</p>
<p>In this example, an advisor has sent a quotation to a customer, but the customer has some follow-up questions, so chooses to begin a web chat from the advisor’s website.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66d08f567acc8d65747cfed6_647dc38e4fba05e77314749c_Screenshot%25202023-06-02%2520103911.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""407"" height=""458""></div>
<figcaption>Customer Request in web-based Live Chat</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The advisor knows from experience that trying to explain the detail of a mortgage quotation via chat can be confusing for both parties, and could take a long time to resolve over chat. However,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>because the advisor is using our solution, they are able to short-cut this process</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and answer all the customer's questions by suggesting a short video call.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66d08f567acc8d65747cfed3_647dc3aee62f9df8c15e5f9a_Screenshot%25202023-06-02%2520103951.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1219"" height=""494""></div>
<figcaption>Starting a video meeting in Amazon Connect, using Microsoft Teams</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>After checking the user is happy to do this, the advisor clicks the ""Create Meeting Space""&nbsp;button, which automatically sends a join link to the customer. The advisor is then joined into the meeting from within the same window, meaning that they can continue to add notes to the chat for the user to reference afterwards:</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66d08f567acc8d65747cfee6_647dc3fa225896204120d4d3_2023-06-02%252010_45_11-Window.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1220"" height=""494""></div>
<figcaption>Customer and Agent in a live Video call</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>The advisor can now talk directly with the customer, and share their screen to walk through the document, highlighting specific elements as they go. The full transcript of the call will then be dropped into the Amazon Connect Chat, enabling recording and future conversational analysis through Amazon Connect Contact Lens.</p>
<h3>‍Using Amazon Connect with Microsoft Teams Video - How it works</h3>
<p>Agents use a custom-built Contact Control Panel (CCP) to accept incoming calls, or can switch to using it for an established chat they wish to escalate to voice and video.</p>
<p>At this point, a new Microsoft Teams meeting is created. A message is automatically sent to the customer with a unique join link via the established chat conversation. The agent is joined to the same meeting space automatically for a seamless transfer, with the audio and video played within the custom CCP.</p>
<p>The Amazon Connect chat conversation persists throughout the period of the video call in the agent's CCP, and can continue to be used for notes and follow-up messages.</p>
<h3>Value for the Organisation &amp; the Customer</h3>
<p>Combining Amazon Connect and Microsoft Teams in this way provides a number of unique benefits:</p>
<ul role=""list"">
<li>It allows customers to have rich voice, video and screen-sharing interactions with agents</li>
<li>Organisations can brand and customise the video experience via our white-label service.</li>
<li>No plugins are needed. This solution works on modern browsers, on laptops, mobiles and tablets, across Windows, Android and iOS</li>
<li>IT&nbsp;continue to have a single communication platform to manage and optimize</li>
<li>This solution can be easily added to an existing Amazon Connect instance</li>

<!--more--><p>Let’s explore why AI platforms are transforming the future of contact centres and how <strong>Apollo</strong>, our groundbreaking AI-powered solution, is leading this transformation.</p>
<h3>Why AI Matters in Modern Contact Centres</h3>
<p>AI is more than a buzzword; it’s a powerful enabler that addresses some of the biggest challenges facing contact centres today</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong style=""font-size: 22px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"">Enhanced Customer Experience</strong></span></p>
<p>Customers now expect quick, seamless, and personalised support across multiple channels. AI platforms enable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent Routing:</strong> Matching customers with the right agent or resource based on their query and history.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational AI:</strong> Chatbots powered by natural language processing (NLP) handle routine enquiries, freeing agents to focus on complex issues.</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> AI tools monitor tone and language to assess customer emotions, allowing agents to proactively address dissatisfaction</li>

<h4><br>Favourite Quote:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“If you don't say anything, they can't do anything.” <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">My Dad</span></p>
<h4>How long have you worked for CloudInteract?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I joined in October 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What was your first day like?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I was added to Teams and welcomed via the Company Chat channel, introduced myself to everyone with a bit of a backstory of myself. Everyone was extremely welcoming and the jokes/humour came out straight away.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What does working here mean to you?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>I have had been on the receiving end of the consultancy for a number of years and was always frustrated with the way projects were delivered as it always felt like they would build something based on a set of requirements and just hand it over instead of fully understanding the requirements, offering their expertise on the subject and working with us to build it. &nbsp;For me, working here means I get to do what I always wanted to receive, providing experience from various other clients to solve problems and work with the client so they know how its built and provide feedback throughout the project to ensure what is delivered is the best possible solution.</p>
<h4>How would you describe what you do?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Using my past experience working with the business and agents from producing schedules, generating reports, making BAU telephone changes through to large scale telephony deployment projects. I listen to the customer to understand what their end goal is, translate that to technical requirements and determine the best way to architect the solution.</h5>
<h4>What's the best part of your job?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I really enjoy making Agents and End Customers' lives easier! I get really frustrated with poorly structured Contact Centres (as I'm sure a lot of people do!) and love being able to improve that as much as possible with Technology.</h5>
<h4>Describe a typical day...&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Start of the day is checking and updating any issues that we may have outstanding, the rest of the day is then usually split out between building services and catching up with Clients to give updates/demo's etc to get continuous feedback and finally I usually also reach out to a few people for non-work conversations/catch ups.</h5>
<h3>The Fun Part&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>If you could have one superpower, what would it be?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Internal ChatGPT - the ability to automatically know everything!</h5>
<h4>What's your favourite food?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Chicken Tikka Vindaloo with pilau rice and keema naan!</h5>
<h4>If you could be an animal, what would you be and why?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Capybara - Everyone would think I'm super cute and have my own song...</h5>

Whether it’s streamlining repetitive tasks, enhancing agent productivity, or enabling advanced insights, automation offers a wealth of opportunities to transform contact centre operations.</p>
<!--more--><p>At CloudInteract, we’re at the forefront of helping businesses leverage automation to achieve incremental business gains, from reducing costs to increasing customer satisfaction. In this blog, we’ll explore what automation can do for your contact centre, the most impactful use cases, and how CloudInteract can tailor solutions to meet your unique needs.</p>
<h3>What is Contact Centre Automation and Why Does It Matter?</h3>
<p>Contact centre automation leverages technology to perform routine, manual, and often time-consuming tasks, allowing teams to focus on delivering exceptional service. This isn't just about replacing human effort - it’s about enabling better outcomes, faster resolutions, and improved experiences for both customers and employees.</p>
<p>For contact centres, automation benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong></span> Automation reduces the burden of repetitive tasks, enabling agents to focus on complex customer issues.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> </span>Automating processes like call routing or self-service reduces operational overhead.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Enhanced Accuracy:</strong> </span>Automation minimises errors in processes like data entry or ticket categorisation.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Better Customer Experiences:</strong> </span>Faster resolution times and personalised interactions foster customer loyalty.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Scalability:</strong> </span>Automation supports business growth by enabling seamless handling of increased customer volumes.</li>
</ul>
<p>At CloudInteract, we partner with businesses to identify automation opportunities that deliver measurable improvements, tailoring solutions to their operational goals.</p>
<h3>Where Can Automation Deliver the Most Impact in Contact Centres?</h3>
<p>Automation in contact centres spans a range of processes and technologies. Below are some of the most impactful use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong> Intelligent Call Routing</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Manual call routing can be time-consuming and error-prone. Automation tools powered by AI and machine learning ensure that customers are connected to the right agent or department based on their enquiry, preferences, or historical interactions, improving first-call resolution rates.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong> AI-Powered Self-Service</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-service tools, such as chatbots and voice assistants, enable customers to find answers to common questions or complete simple transactions without waiting for an agent. These tools reduce agent workload and enhance customer satisfaction by providing instant support 24/7.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong> Predictive Analytics for Proactive Support</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Using automation to analyse customer data and predict issues before they arise can help businesses deliver proactive support. For example, alerting customers about a potential account issue before it disrupts service builds trust and reduces inbound call volumes.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong> Workforce Management and Scheduling</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Automating workforce management tasks, such as forecasting call volumes and creating schedules, helps ensure optimal staffing levels, reducing costs while maintaining service quality.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong> Real-Time Sentiment Analysis</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Automation tools can monitor customer interactions in real-time to assess sentiment and provide agents with actionable insights to adjust their approach, enhancing the overall customer experience.</p>
<h3>How CloudInteract Delivers Tailored Automation Solutions</h3>

<h5>A wild horse. Sure-footed, brave and free.&nbsp;</h5>

<h4>How long have you worked for CloudInteract?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I joined CloudInteract on 17th June 2024.</h5>
<h4>What was your first day like?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>First day was an exciting confusing mix things. There was a lot in mind like which products I will work on and how’s the environment but after taking a few meetings, I must admit, I feel it is a nice company environment and culture.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What does working here mean to you?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Every day, I am enjoying it. It feels like I am not doing a job but developing myself. Tom is very nice, I like the vibes and ideas we discuss in every meeting, so it gives me a drive to perform well and do things from my heart.</p>
<h4>How would you describe what you do?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I am mainly involved in development rather than specifically working on Amazon Connect. For now I have developed a product with Tom that works as a third party app within Amazon Connect that helps agents to communicate with colleagues on MS Teams.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What's the best part of your job?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Working on new things instead of repeating things is the best part. Every day a new requirements comes up, new challenges which always keep you excited. &nbsp;</h5>

<p><strong>Meet Tom Morgan, CloudInteract’s Platform Architect - </strong>a tech wizard, sardine connoisseur, and part-time cat negotiator (yes, really). When he’s not architecting solutions or herding metaphorical cats, Tom’s busy chasing sunsets in Greece or marveling at his fearless 15-year-old feline’s street smarts. Whether it’s delivering the “impossible” for customers or just surviving another day without a vet visit, Tom’s blend of creativity, grit, and humor keeps things interesting.</p>
<h4>Favourite Quote:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“If you can dream it, you can do it.” <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">Walt Disney</span></p>
<h4>How long have you worked for CloudInteract?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Since January 2023.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What was your first day like?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I’d already been speaking to Nick &amp; Simon, so I sort of knew what I would be doing. It was a day of catching up, finding my feet, and planning for how to deliver on our commitments for the next 6 months.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What does working here mean to you?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>I love the ability to really make a difference in a company, so being a cog in a huge corporate machine isn’t for me. CloudInteract feels like a family of like-minded smart individuals all working together to create amazing outcomes using the best technology we can get our hands on, and making that technology really work for our customers.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How would you describe what you do?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Finding solutions to problems, translating customer requirements into outcomes, architecting robust and scalable code, firefighting, cat herding, and helping to showcase and promote the individual and collective efforts of our world-class engineering team.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What's the best part of your job?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Watching customer reactions when we demo them something that someone else has told them can’t be done.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>Describe a typical day...&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Get up early, run, gym, take my daughter to school, coffee during first meeting, focus on some code, maybe write some documents or have some more meetings, get outside for lunch, more code, more meetings, help with dinner &amp; bedtime, work on personal projects, sleep. &nbsp;</h5>
<h3>The Fun Part&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>If you could have one superpower, what would it be?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>To be able to say no to things without feeling bad.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What's your favourite food?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>That’s a tough one. I think food is shaped completely by place and atmosphere. Sardines are fine, but fresh caught sardines BBQ’d for you in a beach restaurant in Greece, sitting watching the sun go down with your feet in the sand, enjoying a drink with your partner: they’ll taste like some of the best sardines you’ll ever eat.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>If you could be an animal, what would you be and why?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>I think a cat. Specifically, my cat, who seems to sleep 23 hours a day but can still climb a tree or catch a mouse at the elderly age of 15, when he wants to. He’s tiny but faced down a ginger Tom twice his size the other day. I had to break them up, and I thought the Tom was going to go for me, he was massive. No cares in the world, my cat. I think he probably would have won if I’d left him, but I didn’t fancy another trip to the vets to remove another infected claw from his head.&nbsp;</h5>

<p>“Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.” <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">George Bernard Shaw</span></p>
<h4>How long have you worked for CloudInteract?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>1 Year&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What was your first day like?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>My first day was wonderful, I was queried about where I saw myself in the future and how the company can help to make me reach that point. This was followed by pointing out the right people to talk to, in order to enhance my skillset and reach my goals.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What does working here mean to you?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Working at CloudInteract has changed my outlook on the corporate world. The company has allowed me to develop into a vital team member whilst feeling like my work is important to completing each project. The work I do also keeps pushing me toward my goal of being a successful DevOps engineer in the future, making it a pleasure to come to work every day.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How would you describe what you do?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>As a Cloud Engineer, my job is to help clients solve problems using Cloud Technology such as AWS. My day to day can vary a lot, but tasks include testing infrastructure, writing infrastructure as code &amp; helping to optimise contact centres using Amazon Connect&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What's the best part of your job?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>The learning. When joining CloudInteract, it was important to me that I’d have the chance to get hands on and complete some tasks using my existing knowledge so that I could push further. Since being at CloudInteract I have been able to work with several technologies to take me to another level in my career, my personal favourite being Cloud Formation, which enabled me to be able to push on and complete the AWS Solutions Architect Pro Exam.&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>Describe a typical day...&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>For myself there isn’t so much a typical day! I’m lucky enough to work with a number of different skilled people throughout the day, I could be creating routing profiles or pushing deployments through environments. Overall, the one constant would be testing our products and highlighting &amp; supporting the fixing of bugs.&nbsp;</h5>
<h3>The Fun Part&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>If you could have one superpower, what would it be?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>Seeing into the future! This is a power that would let me live in normality whilst being able to benefit from picking the lottery numbers, and seeing how long I’ll have to wait to watch Arsenal win the Champions League without having to fight the bad guys!&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>What's your favourite food?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>In general, I love a chicken burrito but the best thing I’ve ever eaten was a New York Strip steak from Hell’s Kitchen in Las Vegas!&nbsp;</h5>
<h4>If you could be an animal, what would you be and why?&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>An Elephant. They’re such peaceful creatures that tend to stay with their families whilst enjoying beautiful environments, sounds like a perfect life for me!&nbsp;</h5>

<p>Curious about what it takes to transform your contact centre into a future-ready customer experience powerhouse? In this exclusive video, our CEO, Simon Leyland, breaks down the four stages of the CX Maturity Journey. Hear firsthand how these stages come together to create seamless, personalised experiences for your customers - and why there’s no excuse for bad customer service.</p>
<p>This journey is about more than adopting the latest technology. It’s a structured roadmap designed to meet businesses where they are and guide them toward a future-ready contact centre. Our approach unfolds across four distinct stages, each focused on specific challenges and opportunities.<br><br></p>

<h4><strong>Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></h4>
<p>The first step begins with understanding the current state of your contact centre. Many businesses at this stage are juggling outdated systems, minimal integration, and limited visibility into customer behaviour. The result? A reactive service model that’s more about firefighting than building connections.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>: By streamlining infrastructure and integrating systems, businesses can reduce costs and begin creating a more cohesive service experience.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></h4>
<p>With foundational improvements in place, it’s time to explore scalable platforms and connect the dots between systems. Businesses can start leveraging data more effectively and automating basic processes like call summarisation.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>: Real-time reporting and API-driven integrations set the stage for a more proactive and responsive approach to customer service.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></h4>
<p>This is where things really start to transform. Automation takes centre stage, with AI-driven workflows handling up to 80% of routine customer interactions. Human agents focus on high-value cases, backed by AI insights to deliver personalised service.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>: Efficiency skyrockets, customer satisfaction improves, and teams are freed to handle complex, impactful work.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage 4: The Art of the Possible</strong></h4>
<p>Imagine a contact centre where AI predicts customer needs, automates 90% of interactions, and delivers a seamless omnichannel experience. This is the future - a strategic asset that not only meets customer expectations but exceeds them.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>: With proactive, predictive support, businesses can create deeper connections, foster loyalty, and drive growth.</p>
<h4><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h4>
<p>Every business is on a different path, but the destination is the same: delivering exceptional customer experiences. This is about aligning technology, processes, and people to deliver better outcomes - for customers and businesses alike.</p>

The event brought together a dynamic mix of AWS experts, industry leaders, and solution providers to share insights, foster collaboration, and tackle common challenges in the contact centre space.</p>
<!--more--><p>Here’s a look at the highlights, key themes, and valuable lessons from the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">{{cta('190698274033')}}</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>A Platform for Collaboration and Best Practices</strong></span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingjohn/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Ing </a>set the tone early, emphasising the group’s mission: “Bringing the right people together to collaborate, learn, and share.” This sentiment resonated throughout the day as attendees exchanged real-world insights about deploying and optimising Amazon Connect.</p>
<p>“It’s a growing band of people,” John noted. “The idea is to help each other maximise the value of investments we’ve made in using Connect or helping others use it.”</p>
<p>The event attracted a diverse mix of attendees, with numbers slightly up from the first gathering. As Alex Baker observed, “It’s great to see new faces and sponsors. The attendance reflects the value of events like this - getting partners and customers to share tips and tricks.”</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Innovative Solutions on Display</strong></span></h3>
<p>The event showcased cutting-edge solutions built on Amazon Connect. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruben-opdenakker/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Ruben Opdenakker</strong></a>, Head of Product Management at Mobile Connect, shared insights on their mobile application designed to integrate Amazon Connect capabilities for mobile workforces.</p>
<p>“We’re serving people outside the contact centre - salespeople, field technicians, anyone making or receiving customer calls while mobile,” Ruben explained. The app’s seamless integration and WebRTC-first design allow users to leverage Amazon Connect telephony on the go, with PSTN backup for unreliable internet connections.</p>
<p>For Ruben, the biggest industries adopting their solution are <strong>healthcare</strong>, <strong>insurance</strong>, and <strong>banking</strong>, with key markets in the UK and US. “Our mobile app brings the benefits of Amazon Connect to mobile devices, expanding its utility for diverse use cases,” he said.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>Voice Biometrics: Beyond Security</strong></span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-magee-a395b57/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Paul MaGee</strong></a>, CEO of Arraya, delivered a session on voice biometrics, exploring its potential beyond traditional security use cases. He discussed how advancements in cloud technology have made voice biometrics accessible to organisations of all sizes, enabling not just cost savings but also compliance with data privacy regulations.</p>
<p>“Voice biometrics isn’t just for banks or governments anymore,” Paul shared. “It’s for any organisation that handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and wants to offer secure, convenient service without compromising on data protection.”</p>
<p>A key takeaway was Paul’s perspective on multi-layered authentication: “There’s no silver bullet for strong authentication. Voice biometrics should complement other measures, like device identification, to balance security and convenience.”</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>The Evolution of Amazon Connect</strong></span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalipavan/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Pavan Dusanapudi</strong></a>, Lead Solutions Architect for Amazon Connect’s scheduling capabilities, shared insights from his work helping UK banks migrate thousands of agents to the platform. He highlighted the benefits of Amazon Connect’s integrated forecasting, scheduling, and capacity planning tools.</p>
<p>“Our customers wanted native, easy-to-use capabilities infused with AI and ML,” Pavan said. “The result is a platform that automates mundane tasks for contact centre managers, enabling greater efficiency and innovation.”</p>
<p>Pavan also reflected on the global adoption of Amazon Connect, noting that while smaller contact centres in the US often spearheaded its early use, large enterprises in the UK and Australia have embraced it for their most complex operations.</p>
<h4><strong>Expanding the User Group</strong></h4>
<p>The event closed with a look to the future. John Ing shared plans to expand the user group internationally, with potential sessions in the US and Australia. “The challenge is identifying where and how to break into these markets,” he explained. “We’ll likely start small, similar to our first UK event, and build from there.”</p>
<h4><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h4>
<p>For attendees, the event underscored the value of independent forums like this, where users can freely discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from one another. As Alex Baker put it, “It’s a safe space to talk - customers sharing with customers, partners, and AWS all in one room.”</p>
<p>Tom Morgan wraps up the podcast episode with a call to action: “If you’re thinking about attending the next one, don’t hesitate. The value lies in connecting with peers, exchanging ideas, and staying ahead in the ever-evolving world of contact centre technology.”</p>

An Introduction to the Future of Cloud-Based Contact Centres","https://resources.cloudinteract.io/resource-hub/whats-is-amazon-connect","Amazon Connect — a contact centre solution designed to be as adaptable and forward-thinking as the businesses relying on it.","2024-11-24 14:41:10","2024-11-25 05:30:00","<p>When was the last time your contact centre technology truly worked for you? If you're like most leaders managing complex, high-volume customer interactions, you’ve probably faced the frustrations of systems that feel outdated, expensive, and impossible to scale. That’s where <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Amazon Connect</strong></span> comes in — a contact centre solution designed to be as adaptable and forward-thinking as the businesses relying on it.</p>
<!--more--><p>But what exactly is Amazon Connect, and why are forward-thinking CROs, CTOs, and CX Leaders turning to it as a solution for transforming customer experience?</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">A Fully Managed, Cloud-Based Solution</span></h3>
<p>Amazon Connect is a cloud-based, omnichannel contact centre service, designed from the ground up to be highly<span style=""color: #7d55c7;""> <strong>flexible, scalable, and adaptable</strong> </span>to meet modern demands. Unlike traditional contact centres, Amazon Connect eliminates the complexities of managing hardware, networking, and on-premise infrastructure —meaning no more costly upgrades, maintenance, or overcapacity issues.</p>
<p>This solution is built to scale with your business, whether you're managing hundreds of customer interactions per day or scaling up to millions. For industries like <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>EduTech</strong></span>, where seasonal spikes and variations in call volume (e.g., during enrolment periods) are common, Amazon Connect's pay-as-you-go model ensures you only pay for what you use. <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Life Sciences</strong></span> organisations that manage sensitive patient information also benefit from the solution’s robust security features, ensuring compliance without sacrificing customer experience.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Why Cloud Matters Now More Than Ever</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/AI%20bot%20icon.png"" width=""161"" height=""161"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""AI bot icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 161px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Cloud adoption isn’t just a trend — it’s a necessity. With hybrid and fully remote workplaces becoming the new norm and the need for 24/7 service growing, traditional contact centre setups struggle to keep up. Whether you’re a <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Head of Infrastructure</strong></span> managing legacy systems or a <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>CIO</strong> </span>tasked with reducing operational inefficiencies, Amazon Connect offers a streamlined path to modernisation.</p>
<p>For instance, <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Pearson’s</strong></span> utilises Amazon Connect to offer seamless, personalised interactions with learners, whether they're accessing services via phone, chat, or social media. Its cloud-based infrastructure enables faster onboarding for agents and allows for integration with existing CRM and CX systems, a flexibility that few traditional solutions can match.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Built-In AI and Automation: The Power of Personalisation</span></h3>
<p>One of Amazon Connect’s key differentiators is its <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>built-in AI</strong></span> and <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>machine learning</strong></span> capabilities, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Through Amazon Lex, businesses can automate repetitive tasks, such as FAQs or basic enquiries, freeing up agents to focus on more complex, value-added interactions. For <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>CROs</strong> </span>and <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>CX Leads</strong></span>, this translates into quicker resolution times, reduced agent burnout, and better overall customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Take <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Swoop Adventures</strong></span>, a commercial digital business that thrives on delivering swift, tailored services to its customers. By integrating Amazon Connect with their AI-powered systems, they’ve been able to reduce call-handling times and offer personalised experiences based on customer history and behaviour — all while cutting costs.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Real-Time Insights to Drive Better Decisions</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/Ai%20icon.png"" width=""133"" height=""133"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Ai icon"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 133px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">As a leader responsible for managing IT infrastructure or customer experience, having access to real-time data is critical. Amazon Connect provides detailed analytics and reporting, allowing teams to monitor key metrics like wait times, customer sentiment, and agent performance. For example, <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>one of our customers</strong></span>, an organisation in the Life Sciences space, leverages Amazon Connect’s reporting features to continuously optimise their patient support services. Whether your focus is on improving operational efficiency, reducing churn, or delivering hyper-personalised service, these insights offer the data you need to make informed, proactive decisions.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Seamless Integration with Existing Tools</span></h3>
<p>Another advantage of Amazon Connect is its ability to integrate smoothly with your existing business tools. Whether it's integrating with Salesforce, Hubspot, or bespoke industry software, Amazon Connect’s API-driven architecture allows for easy connectivity. <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>IT Directors</strong></span> and <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>CTOs</strong></span> can leverage this flexibility to reduce friction between systems, helping their teams work smarter, not harder.</p>
<p>In an era where downtime or a lag in service can have catastrophic effects on customer loyalty, the stakes for ensuring your contact centre is always running optimally couldn’t be higher.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Can You Afford for Your Contact Centre to Fail?</span></h3>
<p>The reality is that no business can afford poor customer service. Whichever industry you operate in, ensuring your contact centre delivers exceptional, consistent customer experiences is non-negotiable. With Amazon Connect, businesses gain a future-proof solution that can scale, integrate, and adapt to the rapidly evolving needs of their industries.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">A Refreshed User Interface</span></h3>
<p>The AWS console has received a facelift with a sleek, more modern design. This isn't just a cosmetic change - it's about improving the overall user experience. The updated icons and interface make navigating through the platform easier, ensuring users can get to where they need to go faster and with fewer clicks.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Expanding Language Support in Contact Lens</span></h3>
<p>Since August, Amazon Connect has broadened its linguistic horizons. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are now supported in Contact Lens, enhancing transcription and post-call analysis. While real-time analysis for these languages is still a work in progress, this update is a significant step towards providing truly global customer service.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Connect Dashboard Enhancements</span></h3>
<p>In September, Amazon Connect introduced the <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Send Message Contact Flow Block</strong></span>, which is now available for both SMS and email. This feature allows for dynamic message types and templates, making it easier to manage customer communications. But that’s not all - this functionality can now also initiate outbound contact and escalate to live conversations with agents, opening up a whole new avenue for proactive customer engagement.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">SDK and Screen Sharing Capabilities</span></h3>
<p>For those looking to integrate more deeply with AWS Connect, new <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>SDKs for iOS and Android</strong> </span>make native in-app chat a reality. Additionally, the long-requested <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>screen sharing</strong> </span>feature for web and video calls is now available, empowering agents to provide more interactive and visual support when needed.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Forecasting and Capacity Planning via Data Lake Integration</span></h3>
<p>Amazon Connect is taking forecasting and capacity planning to the next level with integration into the <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>data lake</strong></span>. This enhancement makes it easier to access and analyse data, offering businesses valuable insights into their customer service operations. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with AWS praising the seamless integration of this data.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Outbound Campaigns Get a Personal Touch</span></h3>
<p>Outbound campaigns have undergone a major transformation. Now rebranded as <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>personalised and proactive engagement</strong></span>, this feature has inherited functionalities previously found in Pinpoint, such as setting up audience segments. This means businesses can now create more targeted, engaging campaigns that are fine-tuned to meet customer expectations.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Customisable Dashboards and Reports</span></h3>
<p>The reporting experience in Amazon Connect just got a major upgrade. Customisable dashboards allow users to mix and match widgets, adjusting them to their needs for a more intuitive, visual reporting experience. With <strong>threshold alerts</strong> now available, users can set limits on key metrics (like queue answer times) to receive notifications when those thresholds are breached, ensuring teams can stay on top of performance.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #c63db5;"">Amazon Q: Enhanced Knowledge and Personalisation for Agents</span></h3>
<p>Amazon Q has also received a refresh. Now supporting website crawling as a knowledge source, this update makes it even easier for businesses to set up and maintain their knowledge base. The addition of <span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>personalised guidance for agents</strong> </span>ensures that agents have the information they need when they need it, improving response accuracy and boosting customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>These updates reflect Amazon Connect’s ongoing commitment to making customer engagement more intuitive, efficient, and effective. By adding new languages, improving the user interface, and empowering businesses with more advanced features like screen sharing and outbound campaigns, Amazon Connect is continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in customer experience.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking to streamline internal workflows, create more personalised customer journeys, or gain deeper insights into your contact centre’s performance, these new features are designed to help you deliver better, more responsive service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, we had the privilege of joining our partners TD SYNNEX and AWS, along with a number of other industry partners, for their Partner Update Briefing (PUB) session in London. The event provided a platform to discuss the immense value of collaboration and how strong partnerships can lead to better outcomes for our customers.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from the session? Despite the buzz around emerging technologies like Generative AI, many businesses are still taking cautious steps toward adoption.</p>
<p>Why is that? According to IDC, the biggest challenge many businesses face is the shortage of cloud skills within their teams. Gartner adds that companies simply cannot hire and train fast enough to keep pace with the evolving tech landscape. As a result, businesses and their customers are missing out on valuable opportunities to enhance the customer experience due to a lack of internal expertise.</p>
<p>On the flip side, confidence in the success of transformation projects is critical before diving into new technologies. AWS shared that there was a <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">65% increase in cloud budgets</span> during the pandemic, but challenges persist - <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">38% of cloud migration projects</span> finish behind schedule, and a staggering <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">75% exceed their budget</span>. This highlights the need for trusted, experienced partners who can manage projects effectively and ensure ROI. Businesses are looking for partners who can deliver on their promises and demonstrate clear value to both their customers and their bottom line.</p>
<p>After the session, we gathered at Flight Club for a bit of fun and networking, where we also got the chance to demonstrate our darts skills (or lack thereof!) over drinks and nibbles. In true gamification style, it was an enjoyable and inclusive experience that brought people together. Interestingly, while the gamification experience was engaging, it was clear that AI was working behind the scenes, enhancing the smoothness and enjoyment of the experience without being overt. And that’s exactly how AI should feel - seamless and intuitive.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we’ve embraced AI as a core part of our service offerings. By leveraging AI to analyse contact centre data, we gain deep insights into customer journeys and identify areas for improvement. Where are the friction points in your customer journeys? What repetitive tasks could be automated? Which solutions (e.g., CRM) do your agents need to interact with, and how can we better serve your customers? By understanding these elements, we can provide a clear, actionable roadmap to optimise your customer experience and ensure you achieve the ROI you expect.</p>
<p>If you're ready to discover how AI can transform your customer experience, let’s talk. We’re here to help you make informed decisions, streamline processes, and deliver exceptional results.</p>

<h4>Unlocking the Potential of Modern Contact Centres with Amazon Connect and AWS</h4>
<p>Delivering exceptional customer experiences has never been more critical - or more challenging. With technology advancing at a rapid pace, contact centres are transforming to meet the demands of customers who expect seamless, personalised interactions across channels. Our recent webinar, <em>""Reimagine the Future of Your Contact Centre,""</em> brought together leading voices from CloudInteract and AWS to discuss how organisations can leverage Amazon Connect and AWS tools to create agile, scalable, and customer-centric contact centres.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Co-founder Simon Leyland was joined by AWS Solutions Architects Arie Hazekamp and Puneet Badlani in a lively fireside chat that explored best practices, practical use cases, and actionable steps for deploying modern technology in contact centres. Here’s a detailed look at the key themes and insights shared during the session.</p>

<h3>Key Highlights from the Webinar</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creating a Unified, Omnichannel Experience:</strong> Customers expect seamless transitions across channels. Whether interacting via voice, chat, or video, the experience should feel consistent and responsive. Amazon Connect enables this by integrating multiple communication channels into one platform, allowing organisations to engage customers wherever they prefer. As Simon noted, ""Meeting customers where they want to be is crucial to building loyalty and satisfaction.""</li>
<li><strong>Data Management as the Foundation of Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Data is at the heart of effective customer experiences, yet many organisations still struggle with siloed, inconsistent data across systems. With Amazon Connect and AWS, contact centres can centralise and manage data to create a smooth flow of information between channels. When combined with CRM data, this approach significantly reduces customer frustration by allowing agents to pick up conversations seamlessly, no matter the channel.</li>
<li><strong>Practical AI Implementation for Transformative Results:</strong> AI is often touted as a game-changer, but as Arie and Puneet pointed out, successful AI adoption requires a focused, step-by-step approach. AI-powered tools such as Amazon Bedrock can deliver impactful results, but understanding the specific use case is key. As Puneet shared, ""Organisations need to be clear on the outcomes they want from AI, and often, it’s best to start small, experimenting internally before rolling out larger implementations.""</li>
<li><strong>Building a Proactive Customer Experience:</strong> Gone are the days when customer experience was solely reactive. By proactively engaging customers with updates and relevant information, organisations can minimise inbound queries and foster a stronger relationship. Whether it’s providing updates via email or SMS, proactive communication reduces unnecessary calls, saving time and boosting customer satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>The CloudInteract CX Maturity Journey:</strong> Building a best-in-class contact centre doesn’t happen overnight. Our CX Maturity Journey offers a structured approach for contact centres, helping organisations move from foundational operations to fully optimised, AI-driven platforms. The journey involves assessing each stage of CX maturity and developing tailored strategies to elevate customer interactions progressively.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fireside Chat: Your Questions Answered</h3>
<p>The session included a Q&amp;A fireside chat with Simon, Arie, and Puneet, where they tackled pressing questions about security, AI strategy, and operational best practices. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Security and Data Privacy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 18pt;"">Attendees asked how Amazon’s AI solutions handle sensitive data securely, and AWS experts highlighted the robust controls of Amazon Bedrock. Bedrock allows organisations to securely train models within AWS, ensuring that customer data remains private and contained. Puneet emphasised AWS’s commitment to security, saying, “We always treat security as a day-zero priority, allowing customers to control and protect their data.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overcoming Operational Challenges in Contact Centres</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 18pt;"">Managing disparate systems and outdated technologies remains a challenge for many organisations. Arie and Puneet shared their insights on consolidating tools within Amazon Connect to streamline processes, improve onboarding times, and provide agents with the right context, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top Tips for Contact Centre Transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 18pt;"">Arie and Puneet shared actionable recommendations for organisations aiming to reimagine their contact centres. Their advice centred on starting with a clear understanding of customer needs, simplifying business processes, and enabling agents to make empowered decisions. ""When you focus on the employee experience, the customer experience improves naturally,"" Arie noted.</p>

<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: Aileron; font-weight: 300; color: #c63db5;"">Understanding the Challenges of Legacy Systems</span></h3>
<p>Today, many contact centres remain stuck in the past—relying on fragmented systems that are not equipped to meet the expectations of today’s multi-channel, data-driven customer service. These outdated platforms are voice-centric, with limited capabilities for automation or integrated reporting. This not only stifles innovation but also leaves businesses disconnected from their customers.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that CX transformation is more than just upgrading technology. It’s about evolving the way your contact centre operates, so it can respond to changing customer needs with greater agility and efficiency.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_1.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most organisations begin their journey at this stage, where they operate with basic, often disjointed systems and minimal reporting capabilities. Customer interactions are reactive, and businesses focus heavily on managing costs rather than fostering innovation. The lack of integrated tools leads to a fragmented customer experience, with IT and business teams working in silos.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparate Systems:</strong> Multiple disconnected tools result in inconsistent service and limit the ability to innovate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Customer Insights:</strong> Without integrated systems, businesses struggle to gather and analyse data, leaving them without the insights necessary to deliver proactive service.</li>
<li><strong>High Dependency on Agents:</strong> Manual handling of customer interactions leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased agent burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By streamlining your infrastructure and integrating systems, you can overcome these challenges. This shift provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer data</strong> for deeper insights.</li>
<li><strong>Operational efficiencies</strong> by reducing manual workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time reporting</strong> for faster decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_2.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, organisations begin to realise the benefits of modern platforms. Moving to the cloud allows for greater flexibility, more connected systems, and the ability to generate real-time insights that can drive smarter decision-making. Automation begins to take hold, helping to streamline routine tasks and reduce the burden on agents.</p>
<p>Consider a recent example of a global healthcare company we worked with. They were heavily reliant on a legacy system, which cost millions annually and supported only voice interactions. Their challenge was to transition 1,000 agents to the cloud in under five months—while maintaining business continuity. Through a well-structured plan and leveraging cloud technologies, we helped them meet this tight deadline, dramatically cutting costs and vastly improving the system's flexibility.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocking the Full Potential of Data:</strong> While systems may be more connected, businesses often lack the tools or expertise to make data actionable. Many miss opportunities to leverage automation effectively, which limits operational improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Manual and Automated Processes:</strong> As businesses begin automating tasks, it’s common for agents to still handle processes that could be automated, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By integrating systems and automating key processes like call summarisation and reporting, you can unlock the full potential of your data. This not only reduces operational costs but also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more accurate service</strong> through real-time data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Automation of repetitive tasks</strong>, freeing up agents to focus on more complex customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_3.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_3"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, the focus shifts to highly automated workflows powered by AI. With AI-enabled reporting and advanced system integration, contact centres can handle customer interactions more efficiently, reducing the need for manual agent intervention by up to 80%. This frees agents to focus on higher-value tasks that require human empathy and expertise.</p>
<p>For example, we worked with a professional services organisation that moved to cloud-based operations. After analysing thousands of customer interactions, they identified inefficiencies—like high call abandonment rates—that had previously gone unnoticed. With these insights, they rapidly implemented improvements that significantly enhanced both customer satisfaction and operational performance.</p>

<li><strong>Maintaining the Balance Between Automation and Human Service:</strong> As automation increases, there’s a risk of losing the personal touch. It’s crucial to ensure that automation enhances, rather than replaces, the human empathy needed for complex cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value:</strong> AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Without proper data and processes, businesses risk deploying ineffective solutions that fail to improve customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By refining your automation processes and empowering agents with AI-driven insights, you can improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The right balance of AI and human touch can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance service speed and accuracy</strong>, delivering a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support agents</strong> in managing complex interactions, allowing them to excel where human intuition and problem-solving are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_4.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_4"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 4: The Art of the Possible</strong></span></h3>
<p>The final stage of the CX Maturity Journey envisions a fully integrated, AI-powered contact centre that proactively meets customer needs across all channels. In this future-ready environment, AI-driven systems predict and automate up to 90% of customer interactions, allowing human agents to focus on high-touch, complex cases that require empathy and expertise. This balance ensures that your customers receive the best of both worlds—efficient, automated support for simple requests and personalised, human service when it matters most.</p>
<p>A crucial element in this stage is ensuring that automation feels personal, not robotic. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can anticipate customer needs, offering tailored solutions in real time. This level of proactive support doesn’t just meet customer expectations—it exceeds them, creating deeper connections and fostering loyalty.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balancing Automation with Personalisation:</strong> As automation takes on a larger role, it’s essential that customers still feel seen and understood. Personalisation and empathy must remain central, even when most interactions are handled by AI.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value Across All Customer Interactions:</strong> Automation can handle a high volume of queries, but there will always be situations where human expertise is required. Striking the right balance between AI and human touch is key to providing exceptional customer experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By embracing advanced AI and automation, your contact centre can operate with unparalleled efficiency while still maintaining the personalisation customers expect. Key opportunities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive, predictive support</strong>, allowing you to anticipate customer needs and deliver solutions before they even reach out.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced agent capabilities</strong>, freeing them to focus on high-value interactions while AI handles routine enquiries.</li>
<li><strong>A future-ready platform</strong> that positions your business ahead of the competition, capable of delivering exceptional service at scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>At CloudInteract, we believe the future of customer experience is built on this careful balance between technology and human insight. Our CX Maturity Journey helps businesses navigate this transformation, from laying the foundation with integrated systems to exploring the art of the possible with AI-driven innovation.</p>

<div>
<p>Microsoft's Mesh for Microsoft Teams is more than just a platform; it's a visionary leap into integrating mixed reality with collaborative tools. This innovative technology facilitates immersive and interactive virtual meetings, where users can engage with digital content and interact with holographic representations in real-time. In the realm of customer service, Mesh is poised to revolutionise remote assistance, offering a platform that's not just engaging but also richly interactive, transforming the standard of customer interactions for specific use cases, but those use cases are likely to remain niche.</p>
<p>In contrast, Amazon Q in Connect is a contact centre-specific AI-driven generative assistant that is an integral component ofthe Amazon Connect ecosystem. The system employs conversational analytics and natural language processing (NLP) to autonomously identify customer concernsand furnish agents with timely responses and suggested courses of action. This includes expedient access to pertinent documents and knowledge articles, withthe goal of saving agents time and enhancing customer satisfaction. AWS have built over 40 in-built connectors allow Amazon Q to establish connections with company data, information, and systems, allowing it to be tailored to specific business requirements. It streamlines activities such as document summarisation, email drafting, suggested Next Best Action for the agent to offer the customer, research execution, and comparative analysis, thereby decreasing the amount of time personnel allocate to repetitive tasks. Amazon Q additionally guarantees personalised interactions predicated on user roles and permissions, thereby upholding an elevated standard of security and privacy with regard to organisation data.​</p>
<h4><strong>Real-World Applications Making a Difference</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revolutionising Call Routing with AI:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>One of the most tangible applications of AI in customer service is in the realm of intelligent call routing. By leveraging natural language processing, AI systems can swiftly and accurately analyse a customer's query. This enables the AI to direct the call to the most appropriate department or agent, streamlining the process. This not only cuts down on wait times but ensures that customers are speaking to the right person right from the start, significantly reducing frustration and enhancing the overall customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Harnessing Data for Unparalleled Personalisation:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>AI's true strength lies in its ability to analyse vast volumes of dataand extract actionable insights. In contact centres, AI algorithms are adept at parsing through past interactions, purchase histories, and customer preferences. This data-driven approach allows for a level of personalisation previously unattainable. For instance, if a customer has a history of specific queries or issues, AI can identify this trend and inform agents beforehand.This proactive strategy enables agents to offer more tailored, efficient, and relevant responses, greatly enhancing the customer service experience.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive Assistance:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>A Leap Forward in Customer Care: AI's predictive capabilities are revolutionising customer service. By analysing a customer's interaction history, AI can proactively offer solutions, often before the customer has fully expressed their needs.This level of anticipatory service not only streamlines the resolution process but also significantly boosts customer satisfaction. Customers feel understood and valued, as their needs are anticipated and addressed with minimal effort on their part.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion Recognition:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Adding a Layer of Empathy: The advent of emotion recognition in AI systems marks a significant advancement in customer service technology. These systems can now detect subtle emotional cues in a customer's voice or text messages, providing human agents with invaluable insights into the customer's current mood. This capability enables agents to tailor their approach, ensuring interactions are not only effective but also empathetic. It's a step towards more human-centric AI, where technology aids in understanding and responding to the emotional nuances of customer interactions.</p>
<p>Through these innovative implementations and practical applications, AI is proving to be a transformative force in customer service. It's not just reshaping the future; it's redefining the present, offering more efficient, personalised, and empathetic experiences for customers. As we continue to explore and expand the capabilities of AI, it stands to redefine the landscape of customer engagement, making every interaction more meaningful and impactful.</p>

Enhance your digital interactions today.","2024-11-16 13:33:57","2024-11-19 14:33:29","<p>In this digital era, effective and seamless communication is paramount, and Amazon Connect continues to lead the way in providing innovative solutions, most recently with the release of In-App, Web and Video calling at the end of November 2023.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the realm of chat communication, Amazon Connect has allowed the integration of Amazon Lex for some time - enabling agent-less interactions and allowing for a smooth transition to an agent when necessary. This can be elevated by leveraging interactive menus in various engaging forms such as quick replies, carousels, and list menus. I’ll touch on these and some examples in this blog. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The spotlight of this blog post, however, is on In-App, Web, and Video Calling capabilities. These capabilities empower businesses to offer personalised voice and video experiences directly on their websites and mobile applications. Customers can now connect with ease, eliminating the need to navigate away from the platform. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes with the extension of the Amazon Connect Chat Widget into a fully managed Communication Widget, with incredible ease of implementation. AWS (Amazon Web Services) does provide the SDK and tools necessary to develop a fully custom experience if you prefer to do so, but this blog will focus on the speed and ease that you can get started with the out-of-the-box widget.</p>
<h3><strong>Spotlight: In-App, Web, and Video Calling Capabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Just how simple is it to get started?</p>
<p>From the Amazon Connect Dashboard, navigate to Channels -&gt; Communication Widgets using the menu on the left-hand side.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d74fb34653d65afab137b2_1.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1413"" height=""690""></div>
</figure>
<p>Click 'Add a Widget.'</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d74fccdfd0dea605a661d9_2.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1240"" height=""480""></div>
</figure>
<p>Configure your preferences, here you can select the channels that you want to make available from your widget. You can also choose to enable/disable video for both Agent and Customer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here you need to specify which contact flow you’re going to use for each channel – for Chat, you may want to use a flow integrated with Amazon Lex to handle some queries without the need for an Agent. For Web Calling you could select an existing flow used for phone call routing without needing to do any extra development.</p>
<p>If you’re just getting started, then you can pick the ‘Sample queue customer’ flow provided by Amazon Connect, this will simply route customers to the Basic Queue on any channel. &nbsp;</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d750347020978f9f8fffb7_3%5B78%5D.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1167"" height=""1195""></div>
</figure>
<p>On the next page, you’re given a whole host of customisation options for your widget. You can change the colour of different parts of the widget to match your branding, change the font style/size and even add your company logo – you can visualise the changes in the preview on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>Once you’re finished, or if you’re just wanting to get started quickly, click ‘Save and continue.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d7503d0a195175efd8698f_4%5B76%5D.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1172"" height=""1253""></div>
</figure>
<p>You then have the option to add the domains that you want to use to display your widget. If you want to add the widget to a simple webpage and test it out locally, you can simply add<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://localhost:3000/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://localhost:3000</a>. Otherwise, if you’re going to add your widget to a webpage distributed using CloudFront for example, you can add the CloudFront URL here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You also have the option to secure your communication widget further with JSON web tokens if you wish, this is likely something you’ll consider for a production build, but if you’re just getting started then skip the step as there’s additional development required.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d7255293c7dd50d5c0837f_5.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""602"" height=""367""></div>
</figure>
<p>And that’s it! In just 3 pages, your chat widget has been created and it’s ready to be added to your webpage or application.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d7256dafa6be22dcc5e97b_6.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""596"" height=""543""></div>
</figure>
<p>Amazon Connect provide a JavaScript snippet that you can use to add the widget to your page, once you’ve added the script, you’ll see the icon to open your widget in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.</p>
<h3><strong>Add your W</strong>‍<strong>idget to a Simple React App</strong></h3>
<p>To implement this onto a blank page using React, you can follow the below steps (You’ll need node.js and the create-react-app library installed.)</p>
<p>Using the command line/terminal, navigate to the folder that you want to create your react site in.</p>
<p>Use the command `npx create-react-app my-app` replacing my-app with a name of your choice. This will create all of the folders and files needed for your project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then in App.js, replace everything with the below snippet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""code-container""><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee; letter-spacing: 0px;"">import React, { useEffect } from 'react';</span>
<pre><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;"">function App() {
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.type = 'text/javascript';
        script.innerHTML = `
            YOUR WIDGET SCRIPT HERE (remove the
<script></script>
tags at the top and bottom) </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;""> `; </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;""> document.body.appendChild(script); </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;""> }, []); </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;""> return (</span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;""> &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></pre>
<pre id=""codeBlock""><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;"">    ); </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;"">} </span><br><span style=""background-color: #eeeeee;"">export default App;</span></pre>
</div>
<script>
function copyCode() {
    var codeBlock = document.getElementById(""codeBlock"");
    var range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNode(codeBlock);
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    window.getSelection().addRange(range);
    document.execCommand(""copy"");
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    alert(""Code copied to clipboard!"");
}
</script>
<p>Then save, and in your terminal navigate into the project folder and use command `npm run start`. Your webpage will launch on your localhost (make sure you added localhost to your widget domains!) and you’ll see the widget icon in the bottom right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In less than 5 minutes, you’ve set up chat, web, and video calling – while it may be a very basic implementation, you’ve got a canvas to add all the enhancements that you want. Your customer now no longer needs to navigate away from your page or pick up the phone to have a voice interaction and you can leverage your webpage or application to pass contextual information to Amazon Connect, enabling you to personalize the customer experience based on attributes such as the customer’s profile, authentication status, or actions previously taken.</p>
<h4><strong>Considerations:</strong></h4>
<p>1. If you’re implementing the out-of-the-box communications widget and allowing chat as a channel, when the widget opens in your application or webpage, the chat is automatically started. If you’re using basic routing straight to a queue, every time the widget is opened, an agent will be connected with a customer and so you may want to consider integrating Amazon Lex into your chat flow if you haven’t already, you can develop your Lex Bot to handle any FAQs, before handing off to an agent when necessary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can make use of powerful features like Chat Interactive Menus to enhance your customer experience when using chat. Interactive Menus provide customers with intuitive views of the things that they can ask/do with your chat assistant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Interactive messages come in the form of List picker, Time picker, Panel, Quick reply, and Carousel.</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/interactive-messages.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/interactive-messages.html</a></p>
<p>Here are just a few examples of how Interactive Menus can be used: &nbsp;</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Carousel with Images</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d76f0537cd0747ba416698_7.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""524"" height=""725"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>

</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>2. If a customer has started a conversation via the chat channel and then wishes to escalate to voice, this cannot be done without additional development. Out of the box, when a customer clicks ‘Start a Call’, the current chat will end and a separate unlinked voice contact will be started and so without additional development/routing logic, that customer could end up at the back of a queue, connected to a different agent without the context of their initial conversation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Escalation from Voice to Video, however, can be done seamlessly and does not require any additional development. Just make sure that your agent Security Profile has Video Calling enabled, otherwise they won’t be able to view or send video.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65d76f5ffc9424298dceec20_12.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1146"" height=""397"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>3. Cost – Web calling can offer a low-cost avenue into your contact centre, with audio usage charge currently $0.01 per minute, in addition to the Amazon Connect service usage charge of $0.018 per minute. With web calling you do not need to manage or pay for inbound phone numbers and so may prove to be a lower maintenance route – whether this provides a lower cost than your telephony route will come down to the location and types of numbers that you’re using. Usage of the video channel is charged at $0.015 per minute for each connection – that means that if both agent and customer are sending video, the total cost is $0.03 per minute for video, in addition to the audio usage cost of $0.01 and service usage cost of $0.018. Video is an extremely powerful channel that can provide an excellent customer experience and Amazon Connect provides that out-of-the-box for a low cost, but you may want to consider necessity as it does add to your bill. A full breakdown of cost can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing.</p>

<div>
<p>In the dynamic world of customer service, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the personalisation of the customer journey is not just an innovation; it's a revolution. Especially within contact centres, AI is redefining the norms of customer engagement. By harnessing the power of AI, businesses are now transcending traditional service boundaries, offering unprecedented levels of personalised service that enrich both automated and human-agent interactions.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Crafting a Comprehensive Customer Saga with AI</strong>‍</span></h4>
<p>One of the most transformative aspects of AI is its capacity to amass and analyse a customer's entire interaction history with a company. This includes every purchase, communication, piece of feedback, and expressed preference. AI's ability to tap into this vast reservoir of data equips it to provide a panoramic view of each customer's journey. This ensures interactions are not just relevant but exceptionally tailored, eliminating the repetitive and often frustrating needfor customers to reiterate their stories or preferences.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Predictive Personalisation: A Step Ahead in Customer Service</strong></span></h4>
<p>AI's prowess extends beyond historical data analysis to the realm of predictive customer service. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, AI delves into behavioural patterns, enabling it to anticipate a customer'si mmediate and future needs. This foresight means that customers are often greeted with solutions and suggestions proactively, sometimes even before they fully articulate their needs. This proactive approach streamlines the service process, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction and efficiency.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Virtual Agents: Revolutionising Self-Service</strong></span></h4>
<p>In this AI-enhanced landscape, virtual agents become more than just automated responders; they evolve into sophisticated service providers. Equipped with deep, data-driven insights, these AI-powered virtual agents can manage a wide spectrum of customer service tasks. From resolving common queries to assisting in complex procedures, they offer quick, accurate resolutions. This not only elevates the overall customer experience but also strategically redistributes the work load among human agents, allowing them to focus on areas requiring deeper empathy and complex problem-solving.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Empowering Human Agents with AI Insights</strong></span></h4>
<p>Where human touch is paramount, AI becomes an empowering tool for human agents. With AI-curated detailed customer profiles and predictive insights at their disposal, agents can engage in more impactful, personalised, and efficient interactions. They are better positioned to address specific concerns accurately, provide customised advice, and establish a more profound connection with customers. This enriched interaction leads to a superior level of customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Envisioning theFuture: Personalised Experiences at the Forefront</strong></span></h4>
<p>The trajectory of customer service is unmistakably moving towards a future where AI-driven efficiency and human empathy are inextricably linked. As AI technologies evolve, they pave the way for even more advanced and customised customer experiences. This progressive approach not only aligns with but often exceeds customer expectations, setting a new standard in personalised customer care. It's a redefinition of the customer journey, one that places equal emphasis on technological innovation and the value of human connection.</p>
<p>In embracing this AI-human synergy, we step into a future where technology and empathy blend seamlessly, crafting customer experiences that are not just satisfactory but extraordinary. It's a journey towards redefining customer engagement, where every interaction is a step towards unparalleled satisfaction and loyalty, powered by the unique blend of Human insight and AI.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Take the example of a BPO organisation, whose agents offer&nbsp;IT Support for multiple clients. If the agent is making a call out to a user at Client A, they want to present a CLI of Client A’s main help desk number. Whereas if they are making a call to a user at Client B, they want to present Client B’s UK Support number.</p>
<p>There are a number of suggested ways of implementing some sort of dynamic outbound CLI out there, for example this post on AWS re:Post -<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/connect-dynamic-outbound-caller-id."">https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/connect-dynamic-outbound-caller-id.</a></p>
<p>I didn’t find much existing information on enabling this functionality within a Salesforce-integrated environment however, so hopefully this will be helpful for those with that particular use-case.</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>For this blog, I’ve put together a PoC of how we can utilise the Salesforce CTI Adaptor in conjunction with API Gateway and a couple of Lambda functions, to enable manual outbound CLI selection.</p>
<p>The agent will be able to manually select an outbound identity option from a dropdown list in the embedded CCP within Salesforce, which will present the associated CLI when making an outbound call.</p>
<p>The components we’ll use are as follows:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon Connect</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salesforce (specifically CTI Actions and CTI flows within the Connect CTI Adaptor)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API Gateway</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambda</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DynamoDB</p>
<p>‍</p>

<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65bb8dd7c069b75a482b57cc_Picture%201.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""904"" height=""312""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An AWS account with access to the services mentioned.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Amazon Connect instance, configured and taking inbound/making outbound calls.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Salesforce org with the Amazon Connect CTI Adaptor configured, and which you have admin access.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two phone numbers claimed within your Amazon Connect instance, that you can use as outbound CLIs.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use custom outbound CLIs as opposed to numbers claimed within your Connect instance, you’ll need to raise a support ticket to enable that. Check out this part of the Connect admin guide -<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/queues-callerid.html"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/queues-callerid.html</a><span>&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Walkthrough</strong></h3>
<h4>Create Agent-Identity mapping DB table</h4>
<p>In AWS, navigate to DynamoDB, and create a new table. Name it (I’ve used ‘Agent_Outbound_Identity’ in the example below) and keep a note of the table name for later.</p>
<p>Add the partition key ‘AgentUsername’, and create the table.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65bd0bc82b536ffccf57154d_DDB_Create_Agent_ID_Table.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""815"" height=""552""></div>
</figure>
<p>We don’t need to populate anything in this table for the moment, it will get populated automatically by one of the Lambda functions we create later.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h4><strong>Create Identity - CLI mapping DB table</strong></h4>
<p>Create another new DynamoDB table, with your chosen name (I’ve used ‘Identity_CLI_Config’) and keep a note of the table name for later.</p>
<p>Add the partition key ‘IdentityName’ and create the table.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65bd0ba12b536ffccf56f35f_DDB_Create_Identity_CLI_Table.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""816"" height=""552""></div>
</figure>
<p>When the table has been created, click into it and click ‘Explore table items.’&nbsp;We need to add our identities which the agents can select from in the dropdown, and the associated CLIs.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65bd0bdff708417ab0f5323d_DDB_Add_Outbound_ID.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1156"" height=""482""></div>
</figure>
<p>Click ‘Create item.’ Add in the name of the outbound identity, I’ve used ‘Client ABC.’ Then click ‘Add new attribute’, and select ‘String’. In the new field, enter ‘outboundCLI’ as the Attribute name, and your CLI as the value. (Remember that the value will need to be a claimed number within your Connect instance, or you’ll need to have requested it as a custom CLI via a support ticket.)</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11e36e78d09f9ec30f4e8_04_DDB_Add_Outbound_ID_Values.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1292"" height=""409""></div>
</figure>
<p>Click ‘Create item’ and verify that it’s created successfully.</p>
<p>Use the same process to add a second outbound identity with a different phone number for the outbound CLI. I’ve added ‘Client DEF’.</p>

<h4>Create Lambda function to update the outbound identity for an agent</h4>
<p>Next, we need to add a couple of Lambda functions. The first one will be invoked by API Gateway, which is triggered by an agent choosing an outbound identity from a dropdown in Salesforce, which we will get to shortly.</p>
<p>Navigate to the Lambda console, and click ‘Create function’. &nbsp;Give the function a name, I’ve used ‘Outbound_CLI_Update_Identity’.&nbsp;Select ‘Python 3.10’ as the runtime.</p>
<p>Assign a role to the function which allows it to read and update DynamoDB items.</p>

<p>Click ‘Create function’.</p>
<p>Paste the following code into the code editor pane, and then click ‘Deploy’ :</p>
<p>We need to add our DynamoDB table name as an environment variable for the function to refer to.</p>
<p>Go to the ‘Configuration’ tab, then select ‘Environment variables’ from the options on the left hand side. Click ‘Edit.’</p>

<h4><strong>Create Lambda function to check the agent’s current outbound identity</strong></h4>
<p>While we are in Lambda, we are going to add our second Lambda function. This one will be used in the outbound contact flow we’ll set up later. It will check which outbound identity is currently set for the agent making the call.</p>
<p>Create another new Lambda function using Python 3.10 as the runtime, and ensure it has sufficient permissions to read DynamoDB items.</p>

<h4><strong>Create API Gateway to invoke Lambda from Salesforce</strong></h4>
<p>Next step is to set up an API Gateway which can be invoked from a CTI Action in Salesforce, which then triggers our ‘Update_Identity’ Lambda function.</p>
<p>Navigate to the API Gateway console, and click ‘CreateAPI’.&nbsp;In the ‘REST API’ section, click ‘Build’. &nbsp;Add a name for the API and a description, if desired.</p>

<h4><strong>Create CTI Flow in Salesforce</strong></h4>
<p>The next step is to set a couple of things up in Salesforce, which enable an agent to use a dropdown to select their desired outbound CLI to use.</p>
<p>First, we’ll add a CTI Flow.</p>
<p>I haven’t found much detailed documentation around CTI Flow creation; there was a bit of trial and error involved in getting this to work. What we are doing here is getting a couple of values within the CTI Flow (the desired outbound identity, the agent’s username) and combining them with our API Gateway Invoke URL, to provide a string which passes the details over to our Lambda function in the API call.</p>
<p>We need to be in Salesforce, in the ‘AC CTI Adapters’ navigation item. (The prerequisite here is to have already set up your CTI Adapter integration.)</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11f7f49105ae42620c0c8_19_SF_CTI_Adapter_Select.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1304"" height=""499"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Select the CTI Adapter you want to edit and scroll towards the bottom of the config page. Select the ‘CTI Flows’ tab, and click ‘New.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11f8b3c81d755e0a41b85_20_SF_CTI_Flow_New.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1899"" height=""461"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Give the CTI Flow a name, I’ve used ‘Outbound CLI Select’. Select the Source from the drop down as ‘CTI Action’. Ensure the ‘Active’ box is ticked, then click ‘Save.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11f9699582cd4b0e36186_21_SF_CTI_Flow_New_Details.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""952"" height=""732"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>In the CTI Flow editor section, use the ‘Upload’ button to upload this flow template:</p>
<h5><a href=""https://github.com/Cloudnteract/ci-blogs-set-outbound-cli/blob/main/CTI%20Flow/Outbound%20CLI%20Select.json"">Download the file.</a></h5>
<p>‍</p>
<p>You’ll need to make one change to the template, all the other provided values should work fine. Click into the second ‘Set Property’ block from the start.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fa19b093b473dc758d6_22_SF_CTI_Flow_Amend_Flow.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1503"" height=""494"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>You’ll need to add the Invoke URL of your API, that we made a note of earlier, with a suffix of your API stage name, and then a question mark, followed by our ‘outboundIdentityName’ value, and finally an equals sign. &nbsp;You may want to pull this together in a text editor, before pasting it into the CTI Flow. &nbsp;It should look something like this:</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65bb9fa5c2080fd98af2a1f5_Picture%2024.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""904"" height=""34""></div>
</figure>
<p>Paste in the new value, click ‘Add New Value’, then save the CTI Flow:</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fb0a4431d4d32186e26_23_SF_CTI_Flow_Add_URL_Value.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""664"" height=""579"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<h4><strong>Create CTI Action in Salesforce</strong></h4>
<p>Now we need to create a CTI Action which will be visible to an agent in their embedded CCP, and allow them to choose their outbound Identity.</p>
<p>In the Navigation Items dropdown, select ‘CCP ElementEditor.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fbc1c6a88ae2342e5f2_24_SF_CCP_Element_Editor.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""902"" height=""496"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Click ‘New Action’:</p>

<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fc940da098b1e74a94c_25_SF_CCP_Element_Editor_New_Action.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1165"" height=""226"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Give the Action a name. This is the name the agents will see. I’ve used ‘Select Outbound Identity’. Then select the CTI Flow we just configured, from the dropdown.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fd82fe5a19214541b2c_26_SF_CCP_Element_Editor_New_Action_Details.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1300"" height=""448"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Go to section ‘Step 3: Additional Data’. Give the form a title, I’ve used ‘Select Outbound Identity’ again.&nbsp;Add instructions if you wish.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c11fe6cc4be8697e4f00c7_27_SF_CCP_Element_Editor_Form_Overview.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1282"" height=""521"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>Move from the ‘Overview’ tab to the ‘Form fields’ tab. Add a ‘Field Name’ of ‘outboundIdentityName’. (Note that this should be exactly the same as the value referenced in the CTI Flow.)</p>
<p>Add a ‘Label’ of ‘Outbound Identity’, or whatever you want the agent to see as the label.</p>
<p>Select a ‘Field Type’ of ‘Dropdown’.&nbsp;Then add the identity names, as specified in our Identity_CLI_Config DynamoDB table earlier. Tick the ‘Field Required’ box. Then click ‘Finish’, and finally, click ‘Save.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c12008f75b09dfc35db042_28_SF_CCP_Element_Editor_Form_Fields.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1273"" height=""603"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>If we refresh our Salesforce page now, and then log in to the embedded CCP as an agent, we should be able to see our new CTI Action. Bring up the CCP, and click the small arrow on the right-hand side.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c120237a022ebbaddbecb0_29_SF_CCP_Actions_Open.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""333"" height=""573"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>

</figure>
<p>And then you should be able to select the desired Outbound Identity from the dropdown, and click ‘Submit.’</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c1205d1d577804cb008825_31_SF_CCP_Actions_Select.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""331"" height=""571"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>If everything is set up correctly, if we go back to our Agent_Outbound_Identity DynamoDB table, we should be able to see that an entry has been created, mapping our agent username to the Outbound Identity name that we selected from Salesforce.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c1206b99582cd4b0e3d980_32_DDB_Check_Agent_Updated.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1159"" height=""428"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<h4>‍Add customised Outbound contact flow in Connect</h4>
<p>The final few pieces of configuration we need are in Amazon Connect. We need to add an Outbound contact flow which will dynamically use the agent’s chosen Outbound Identity when making a call. &nbsp;We’ll also need to make one of our Lambda functions available to Amazon Connect, so we can use it in the contact flow.</p>
<p>In the instance settings for your Connect instance, click on ‘Flows’, and scroll down to the ‘AWS Lambda’ section. Select our ‘Outbound_CLI_Check_Identity’ function from the dropdown, and click ‘Add Lambda function’:</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c120768b955225e048039b_33_Connect_Add_Function.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1212"" height=""539"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>

<h4><strong>Add Outbound queue, and add it to Routing Profile</strong></h4>
<p>The Outbound whisper flow is determined within the configuration for a particular queue. I’ve set up a specific queue for outbound calls, which invokes our new Outbound whisper flow. (There are a couple of limitations to this approach, which we’ll mention in the conclusion.)</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c120cf572042dc73fc0175_39_Connect_Outbound_Queue.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1007"" height=""760"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>
</figure>
<p>The last step is to configure the Default outbound queue within the Routing profile for agents using this solution. I’ve selected the ‘Outbound Identity Selection’ queue from the previous step, as the outbound queue in my Routing profile:</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/65c120d6b33c19be1a4174e4_40_Connect_Outbound_Queue_To_RP.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""1019"" height=""445"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></div>

<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Test…</strong></h3>
<p>As an agent in Salesforce, you should now be able to toggle between Outbound Identities. &nbsp;Try switching between them, and make a call to your mobile, using each identity. &nbsp;Confirm that the presented CLIi is correct in each case.</p>
<p>We’ve used the Salesforce CTI Adaptor, plus a couple of AWS services, to enable manual selection of outbound caller identity. We’ve provided this in a user-friendly way, within the agent’s existing embedded CCP workspace in Salesforce.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are a few potential limitations to this implementation. Reporting, for example; in the blog post we assume it’s OK for outbound calls to be attributed to a single outbound queue, whereas in practice if you’re making calls on behalf of multiple clients, you may wish to break down the reporting accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, there is no notification to the agent to tell them which identity they currently have set. So they’d probably need to set the desired identity before each call to be certain of using the correct one.</p>
<p>Finally, for production use you may wish to add additional security to the API Gateway.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact the team at CloudInteract to discuss some of the ways you could work around the limitations above, and expand on this PoC.</p>

<div>
<p>AI is more than just a tool; it has the power to revolutionise industries. With its remarkable speed in processing and analysing vast amounts of data, contact centres can now uncover customer patterns, anticipate their needs, and provide customised solutions with unparalleled precision and pace. This capability enhances routine inquiries, creating the potentialto turn them into opportunities for efficiency. It allows human agents to concentrate on complex and emotionally nuanced interactions, rather than mundane tasks.<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #c63db5;""><strong>What is the outcome</strong>? </span>An exceptional service experience that goes beyond mere efficiency, ensuring that every customer feels truly seen and appreciated.</p>
<p>In the realm of AI's logic and algorithms, human agents are THE vital element. We possess a unique ability to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level, a skill that artificial intelligence has not yet truly mastered. Humans possess a unique ability to interpret emotional nuances, comprehend intricate situations, and provide compassion, which are essential qualities in the field of customer service. With the support of AI-driven insights, human agents can establish deeper connections with customers, fostering a personal bond that truly resonates.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Picture a situation where artificial intelligence and human agents work together in real-time. AI, with its real-time data analysis and insights, serves as a valuable tool, assisting human agents in navigating customer interactions. This collaboration not only improves the customer experience, but also serves as an ongoing learning experience for agents. They acquire valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviours, setting the stage for even more customised future interactions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The key is finding the right balance between the efficiency of AI and the personal touch. Although AI has the ability to automate and optimise processes, it is the personal touch that truly makes a difference, cultivating strong customer connections. The objective is to utilise AI to enhance human abilities, fostering a harmonious coexistence of technology and empathy.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As we move ahead, the integration of AI and human empathy is poised to become the foundation of customer experience in contact centres. This shift in thinking holds the potential for a future<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>where<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>efficiency and empathy converge, where technology amplifies human interaction instead of supplanting it. It's a vision that envisions a new era of customer service, where technology and human interaction are equally valued.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>By fully embracing this new paradigm, we enter a realm where the worlds of technology and humanity intersect, creating customer experiences that go beyond mere satisfaction and become truly unforgettable. Embark on a transformative path to revolutionise customer engagement, where satisfaction and loyalty soar to unprecedented levels, fuelled by the perfect blend of human expertise and cutting-edge AI technology.</p>

<h3>Evaluate, Visualise, Learn</h3>
<p>In our last instalment of this mini-series, we’re going to focus on Agent Evaluations. Within Amazon Connect, Agent Supervisors can search for a contact record, listen to audio recordings and choose an evaluation form to help score their Agent’s performance. Additionally, using Contact Lens, call summarisations, transcriptions, and Agent-Customer sentiment can be utilised, providing further insight.</p>
<p>This enables the Supervisor to evaluate any Agent-Customer interaction, and understand how enquiries are dealt with, and issues resolved, for any given contact.</p>
<p>Evaluation feedback can then be used for training purposes to help improve Agent knowledge and performance, and ultimately ensure the best Customer experience.</p>
<p>As part of CloudInteract’s suite of Amazon Connect reports, we visualise a range of metrics to help you understand and track:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of evaluations performed, and how they trend over time</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation scores, and how they trend over time</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall percentage of contacts that were evaluated</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of evaluations completed per Agent and/or Queue</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Supervisors are hitting volume targets, e.g. XX number of evaluations performed per Agent per month</p>
<h3>Why Perform Agent Evaluations?</h3>
<p>Contact Centre Supervisors are continually reviewing calls, to learn how to improve the Customer experience. Agent Evaluation scores can reveal:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality and depth of training</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product knowledge</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarity of speech and language</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caller expectation management</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional manner and attitude</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concentration and customer focus</p>
<h3>The Evaluation Journey in Amazon Connect</h3>
<p>Using Sentiment or CSAT dashboards as a start-point for Agent Evaluation enables the Supervisor to contextualise their analysis, and focus on clear hypotheses, such as:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agents have been well trained in learning about a new product</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New starters take approx. 4 weeks to achieve consistent CSAT scores</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a knowledge shortfall in XX queue</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agent X has a great method for calming frustrated callers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do evaluations ensure that Supervisors are regularly reviewing their Agents, but they also provide insight to the Supervisor’s ownability to drive their team forward. If scores are consistently poor, has additional training been requested? Has negative behaviour been addressed?</p>
<h3>Continual Assessment with Agent Evaluations</h3>
<p>Sometimes, Agents can request a re-score. Frequently disputed scores could indicate that a Supervisor is showing signs of bias, lack of understanding, or unrealistic expectations. Perhaps the question scores are incorrectly weighted.</p>
<p>Do the evaluators need further training? &nbsp;Do criteria need to be broken out to pinpoint the disputed questions/clarify what’s being evaluated, so there’s no ambiguity between what the evaluator is scoring against, and what the Agent thinks they’re being scored for?</p>
<p>However Amazon Connect’s Agent Evaluations are used, there is no doubt that they bring opportunities to drive value for your business. Here’s a reminder: &nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlights areas for further training</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinpoints knowledge deficit</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reveals trending topics and customer expectations</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions whether tools are up to scratch e.g. knowledge base</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifies ‘champions’; live examples of troubleshooting, demonstrating a positive attitude, and remaining calm under pressure</p>

<p>Next in our Expert Analytics series, we’re moving on from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.cloudinteract.io/post/actionable-nps-insight-from-amazon-connect"">NPS</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to Amazon Connect Post-Call Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) surveys, for a deeper look at how customers really feel about your business and how we at CloudInteract visualise the results.</p>
<p>For finer-grained non-NPS type reporting, CSAT Surveys are an extremely powerful way to receive real feedback and insights from your customers on the quality of service received. Visual representation turns a static number into a fascinating barometer of changing customer sentiment and brand perception over time, enabling you to continually improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>By configuring your questions to be scored on a numeric range using any scale between 1 and 10 (0-9 response), it’s possible to measure CSAT scores given to curated questions to help assess Agent experience, knowledge, attitude and overall level of service provided to your customers.</p>
<p>Our Surveys dashboard below presents the overall CSAT score (across all answered questions) as a high-level stat, trending over time, and included as a comparison data point against individually scored questions, Agents and Queues.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/64ad2fc96a354ff0116b3407_86a5bc25.png"" alt=""CloudInteract's Power BI Dashboard of Amazon CSAT Survey"" loading=""lazy"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""1504"" height=""838""></div>
<figcaption>CloudInteract's Amazon CSAT Survey Dashboard</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This makes it easy for an Agent Supervisor to understand:</p>
<p>1. The current level of CSAT, and whether that score is degrading or performing better over time</p>
<p>2. Individual Agent performance</p>
<p>3. If there are lower CSAT scores associated with particular queues, as potential problem areas requiring further investigation</p>
<p>Agent Supervisors can focus in on potential issues simply by selecting a particular queue, to filter all question scores and agents associated with it. Similarly, by using date range filters it’s possible to target specific points in time to help diagnose problem areas, providing insight to correlations and causations.</p>
<h3>What If Customers Don’t Answer Every Question?</h3>
<p>As with NPS, there will be customers who choose not to answer CSAT questions. Of those who do, the numbers often drop as they progress through the survey. So in quantifying CSAT scores, it’s important to contextualise by looking at percentages.</p>
<p>Let’s consider this example; in a 4-question CSAT Survey, an average score of 9 for the 4th question ‘How likely are you to recommend AnyCompany.com to a friend?’ certainly sounds impressive. But, when data shows that only 16% of customers offered the survey started it, and only 22% of those reached and answered question 4 – it suddenly becomes less meaningful.</p>
<p>So, let’s say that the percentage of customers staying in the survey and reaching question 4 increased noticeably in Jan 23 – a month in which the first 2 questions had been reworded. Shorter listening time led to greater engagement, and resulted in 43% of customers completing question 4, the end of the survey. Thus the average score of 8.7, whilst lower than 9, was more statistically valid and a truer reflection of how customers felt about recommending the company to friends.</p>
<p>Capturing and visualising CSAT data is therefore invaluable not only for tracking service levels, but also the effects of any changes made to contact flows, operational procedures, staffing or technology.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting with CSAT</h3>
<p>Looking at it from a different perspective, we could start from the top level - AnyCompany.com’s overall average survey score of 6.8. Putting aside percentage of customers moving through the survey, we could ask ourselves; is there a question that frequently destroys the overall average?</p>
<ul>
<li>If the question is about the Agent’s handling of the call, in terms of attitude and knowledge, that could indicate a need for additional training</li>
<li>If the question is about the time spent queuing, there may be an issue with workforce management</li>
<li>If the question is about smooth progression through the IVR, the prompts may need to be reviewed and rewritten to improve signposting</li>
</ul>
<p>CloudInteract’s Data Analytics Specialist Rush Nour makes it his mission to surface complicated data in a way that is visually stunning, makes immediate sense, and yet can be filtered and drilled into for deeper insight and further analysis. As powerful tools for monitoring Agent and service performance and keeping track of brand perception and operational issues, Rush’s BI dashboards are available 24/7 and can be easily shared and collaborated upon.</p>
<p>So here’s a recap of why understanding CSAT data is so important. It can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create better customer experiences</li>
<li>Prompt ideas for product and service improvement</li>
<li>Identify and resolve common process bottlenecks</li>
<li>Help find brand advocates</li>

<p>CloudInteract offers a wide range of both near real-time (NRT) reporting and historic reporting including Lex bots for voice/text etc and Contact Lens analytics to help you make data driven decisions and understand patterns and trends over time, curated in Power BI, Tableau or QuickSight.</p>
<p>In the first of our Business Intelligence blogs within the Expert series, our resident expert Rush Nour looks at how to utilise the wealth of NPS data captured by Amazon Connect, and transform it into tangible business value.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look….</p>
<h3>NPS – More than just a number</h3>
<p>Net Promoter Score, or NPS, is a standard measurement of customer satisfaction, often captured at the end of a call or chat between a customer and a customer service agent. This is important for the agent’s progression, their manager’s targets, and ultimately the business itself. After all, a happy customer is a loyal customer.</p>
<p>A critical measure in tracking customer loyalty, contact centres commonly task their employees with meeting a target NPS on a monthly basis, ensuring customers receive a high level of service. But there’s a lot more to it than one big number.</p>
<h3>Data nuances = significant insights</h3>
<p>Focusing on the headline number provides assurance to the business, but it doesn’t explain how the score came to be given. Amazon Connect amasses a wealth of data during every call; the challenge is turning this into meaningful information. Dashboards must be interactive and intuitive; they must serve as quick-glance aids to info, as well as deep-dive analysis tools. They must also be appealing and accessible to everyone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Power BI offers the opportunity for client to harness the data into stunning visuals – let’s look at what an example below, achieved from the raw data.</p>
<p>‍</p>

<p>‍</p>
<h3>NPS and how to explore it</h3>
<p>From this single dashboard, we can see real-time and historical NPS, and apply filters for deeper analysis:</p>
<ul role=""list"">
<li>NPS scores over time; for a particular time period, a certain queue or group of queues, for a particular agent</li>
<li>Correlation between NPS and number of holds &nbsp;- if callers are frequently put on hold, there may be knowledge gaps that require Agent training</li>
<li>Average queue duration</li>
<li>Correlation between NPS and time in queue - if longer queues mean lower scores, is there adequate resource in place?</li>
</ul>
<p>The overview looks positive, but what happens if you isolate a period of time, or look at a particular queue?</p>
<p>Persistently low scores within a certain queue are concerning, raising a number of questions;</p>
<ul role=""list"">
<li>Is the score driven by specific Agents?</li>
<li>Are these Agents established in their role?</li>
<li>Have they been successfully onboarded?</li>
<li>Is more training required for that skill set /knowledge base?</li>
<li>Has the contact flow recently changed?</li>
<li>Were there any connectivity issues over the selected period of time?</li>
<li>Does the contact flow relate to a new productor service that’s unfamiliar to customers calling in?</li>
<li>Is the queue sufficiently staffed to handle the level of calls?</li>
</ul>
<p>Straight away, by simply scratching the surface, a seemingly decent NPS can reveal multiple areas for improvement.</p>
<p>‍</p>

<p>‍Of course, not every caller chooses to rate their experience; this tends to smooth the polarised values into amid-range score that offers little insight to the customer’s thoughts and feelings. This is why our Data Analytics Specialist, Rush Nour, spends so much time visualising the data we do have, in order to understand the data we don’t.</p>

<p>Agent evaluation is an important consideration for all contact centre managers; the ability to gauge performance, highlight star performers, and offer help and training to those who need it. However, searching for those evaluations isn't available out-of-the-box with Amazon Connect.</p>
<p>So we're going to show you how to find, filter and rank your agent evaluations in this tech how-to guide from one of our top solutions architects, Alex Baker.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>When evaluation forms became available in Amazon Connect back in November 2022 (<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-connect-contact-lens-agent-performance-evaluation-forms/"">See AWS blog here</a>), they came just in the nick of time for a couple of customer use cases we’ve been working on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of a customer's business units have existing quality forms which are not integrated with their current contact centre platform. &nbsp;The migration to Amazon Connect is a great opportunity to rectify that. &nbsp;We’ve configured equivalent forms within AWS&nbsp;Connect so that they can evaluate directly from the contact search portal.</p>
<p>One thing we noticed about the Connect evaluation forms functionality however, is that once you’ve performed evaluations on contacts, there’s no apparent way of searching for previously evaluated contacts (at least when performing them manually, as opposed to using Contact Lens).</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Overview - Enabling Search for Evaluated Contacts</strong></h3>
<p>For this blog, I’ve put together a quick Proof of Concept showing how we can utilise a Lambda function, plus some custom search attributes, to allow us to search and filter for contacts which have been evaluated. &nbsp;I also included a grading of the evaluation scores as a second attribute, so we can filter for contacts with a “Low”, “Medium” or “High” grade.</p>
<p>The components we’ll use are as follows:</p>

<h4><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An AWS account with access to the services mentioned</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-instances.html"">Amazon Connect instance</a>, configured and taking inbound calls</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How To:&nbsp;Make your Evaluations searchable in Amazon Connect</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Confirm Evaluations storage location</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigate to your Amazon Connect instance overview, and to Data storage</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a note of the S3 bucket and folder where your Evaluations are stored</p>
<p>‍</p>

</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Configure Lambda function</strong></h3>
<p>In the Lambda console, add a new Python Lambda function, and use the code provided below. &nbsp;You can adjust the gradings for the evaluation score if required.</p>
<p>You’ll need to assign appropriate IAM permissions to allow the Lambda function to call S3 and Amazon Connect.</p>

</div>
<p>We’ll need to add an environment variable, ‘INSTANCE_ID’, in the Configuration of the Lambda function. Add your Connect instance ID.</p>

<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Add Lambda trigger for Evaluations S3 bucket</strong></h3>
<p>In order to get the Lambda function to run when an evaluation is completed, we need to allow it to be triggered by an S3 PUT.</p>
<p>In the Lambda function overview, click ‘Add Trigger’, and select S3 as the source. &nbsp;Select the bucket that we noted down earlier. Choose Event type ‘PUT’.</p>
<p>Also add a prefix, to select the Contact Evaluations folder within your Connect bucket that we noted down earlier. &nbsp;For example ‘connect/exampleinstancename/ContactEvaluations. &nbsp;Save the trigger.</p>
<p>We should end up with a trigger set up with your bucket and folder names specified:</p>
<p>‍</p>

</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Setting up custom search attributes in Connect contact search</strong></h3>
<p>So that we can search for evaluated contacts, and filter for those with a certain grading, we need to add a couple of custom search attributes.</p>
<p>In Connect, navigate to contact search. &nbsp;Click ‘Add Filter’, then ‘Custom contact attribute’:</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66b246b52a79c4fa09ebdd07_643d50230aff904d92cee7ab_Custom%2520Search%2520attributes%2520setup%2520Amazon%2520Connect.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Screen grab showing where to add custom attribute filter in Amazon Connect"" width=""1121"" height=""541""></div>

<p>‍</p>
<p>Click on the settings cog icon in the attributes pop out:</p>

</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>In the new tab which pops out, we can add contact attributes which should be searchable. &nbsp;Note that these only apply for new calls you make after adding these.</p>
<p>Add the two attributes that we’ve referenced in the Lambda function – ‘contactEvaluated’ and ‘evaluationGrade’, clicking ‘+ Add Key’:</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66b246b52a79c4fa09ebdcfb_643d507bd87b90b34e9f2a3f_Test%2520custom%2520attribute%2520Amazon%2520Connect.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Screen grab showing how to add keys to custom attributes Amazon Connect"" width=""572"" height=""281""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<h3><strong>Time to test evaluated contact search with filters in Amazon Connect</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, make some test calls, and perform some evaluations on those calls. &nbsp;Try a mixture of good and poor evaluation results, so that we can test the grading search.</p>
<p>Once the test calls and evaluations are complete, we can return to Connect contact search and use our custom search attributes to find the calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Click ‘Add Filter’ and select ‘Custom contact attribute’. &nbsp;From the Attribute key drop-down, select our ‘contactEvaluated’ attribute. &nbsp;In the ‘Attribute value(s)’ field, type ‘True’.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66b246b52a79c4fa09ebdd1a_643d527028fee1f2d781ebaf_Amazon%2520Connect%2520contact%2520Evaluated.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Screen grab Amazon Connect how to create filter with custom attribute"" width=""602"" height=""318""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>Searching with the above filter would bring back any calls in the selected timeframe which have had an evaluation performed. &nbsp;But let’s add in the other filter for evaluation grade, and we’ll look for those which have a ‘Low’ score. &nbsp;Add another filter for custom attribute. &nbsp;Select the ‘evaluation Grade’ key from the drop-down. &nbsp;And type ‘Low’ as the value:</p>
<p>‍</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66b246b52a79c4fa09ebdd0b_643d509a5256f0607b18166a_Set%2520evaluation%2520grade%2520Amazon%2520Connect.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Screen grab Amazon Connect adding filter for low agent evaluation grade"" width=""527"" height=""267""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>We are left with a list of all our calls which have been evaluated, and have a grade of ‘Low’.</p>
<p>In this post, we used the following components to allow us to search for contacts which have been evaluated, and have achieved a score within a certain grade:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambda function with an S3 trigger</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom contact search attributes in Amazon Connect</p>
<h4>‍So what does this mean for you?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In conclusion, by using a Lambda function and custom search attributes in Amazon Connect, you can quickly search and filter for previously evaluated contacts based on their evaluation scores. This streamlines your contact centre's evaluation process and enables you to optimise your agent performance management. Don't miss out on the benefits of Amazon Connect's evaluation forms - follow these steps and you'll make an instant improvement to the efficiency of your contact centre.</p>

These forces are altering workplaces and industries, and organisations must adapt in order to remain competitive. The COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the significance of digital transformation in allowing businesses to keep up with the fast growth of the market.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Digitalisation facilitates the management of heterogeneous workforces and the expansion of income sources. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2023, 46 percent of businesses that lack a digital strategy will be missing out on potential income. Additionally, the Forum predicts that by 2025, digital ecosystems will produce 30% of all corporate profits worldwide. This digital disruption necessitates a revaluation of customer interaction tactics and a reorganisation of organisations around the provision of exceptional experiences.</p>
<p><em>By 2023,chatbots are going to save the banking, healthcare, and retail sectors up to$11 billion annually. Source Business Insider</em></p>
<p>Conversational AI is a type of technology that lets people talk to computers or systems in the same way they talk to other people. It uses a lot of different technologies, like NLP and NLU, to help machines and people talk to each other in a way that seems natural. Despite being complex, conversational AI deceives consumers with its appearance of simplicity. It may be smoothly implemented into websites, social media applications, and other user interfaces to boost user engagement and replicate real-world discussions.</p>
<h3>Conversational AI&nbsp;Helps You Understand Your Customers</h3>
<p>Conversational AI helps businesses connect with their customers or employees and have smarter, more natural conversations. It can do everything from answer simple requests for information to manage complicated customer journeys and act like a person. It can start both attended and unattended RPA tasks and talk to the corporate software that is already in use.</p>
<p>What makes Conversational AI so intriguing is its capacity to revolutionise the whole process of external and internal corporate involvement across all business domains. It may be seamlessly linked with numerous corporate processes, including customer service, sales, human resources, accounts payable, procurement, and marketing. Business users and consumers without prior IT expertise may connect seamlessly with intelligent virtual assistants to fix business issues or automate repetitive operations, resulting in a frictionless experience that increases engagement and brand preference.</p>
<p>Customers nowadays are digitally sophisticated, well-informed, and have high expectations for prompt problem response. Providing a great customer experience is essential for businesses to retain customer happiness, constant income, and long-term viability in the face of intensifying global competition. As the world transitions to a totally digital state, firms must emphasise the digital customer experience to maintain their position as industry leaders. This involves ensuring that consumers feel understood and heard across all channels.</p>
<p>Conversational AI is a paradigm shift in the sector of customer experience. According to research, poor customer experiences can result in a substantial loss of revenue, with 91% of disgruntled consumers severing relations with a brand and40% denouncing it publicly. The income streams of companies that have invested in conversational AI have increased by 15%.</p>
<h3><strong>An Opportunity to Revolutionise Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>Conversational AI uses data analysis to create detailed client personas that include personal preferences, likes, dislikes, and motivations. This gives customer interactions an unmatched level of customisation. Conversational AI can aid organisations in retaining consumers and preventing customer churn by anticipating possible issues and providing timely answers.</p>
<p>Business Insider projects that by 2023, chatbots will save the banking, healthcare, and retail industries up to $11 billion a year. Conversational AI, on the other hand, goes beyond the simplicity of chatbots. Conversational AI can understand what the user is saying and what they want, so it can help them in real time and in a clear way. In contrast to chatbots, which can only respond to pre-programmed questions and lack the ability to ""think"" independently, chatbots are limited to answering only pre-determined questions. Its functional superiority makes it a formidable weapon that businesses may deploy to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<p>Conversational AI is an intriguing technology that is altering the field of customer experience. It allows businesses to create a connection with consumers, customise their experiences, and offer them relevant content.</p>

<p>In today's fast-paced world, maintaining seamless communication with customers is crucial for businesses across all industries. Whether you're a financial institution, a healthcare provider, or an e-commerce giant, ensuring that customers stay engaged is vital. When your business requires them to complete necessary tasks on time, it becomes critical.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a contractor working in a highly regulated environment, who’s required to complete DBS checks every 3mths to secure their ongoing employment. Or an online learner whose course upgrade is delayed, cancelled or withdrawn due to a missed deadline. A self-employed worker whose license to trade and insurance cover depends upon the timely completion of skill-based exams.</p>
<p>Risking their eligibility for a role, medical procedure, professional qualification or trading opportunity due to missing documents and information can have a dramatic and immediate effect.</p>
<h2>Find out how Amazon Connect Helps Customers</h2>
<p>In this blog post, we'll explore how you can leverage the power of Amazon Connect and various AWS services to streamline outbound dialling, among other automated communication options. We'll specifically focus on reminding customers to submit important documents, offering email instructions, and implementing text message reminders, whilst also enhancing customer experience and satisfaction. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Proactive, Personalised Outbound Campaigns &nbsp;</h2>
<p>With its seamless integration capabilities, Amazon Connect paves the way for a simplified and automated communication process. Our use case for this blog is a common challenge that businesses face: customers forgetting to submit important documents or complete crucial tasks. Amazon Connect and AWS offer the building blocks to a deliver a valuable solution by allowing you to create and tailor outbound dialling campaigns targeted at these specific scenarios. By leveraging variations of our solution, you can proactively remind customers about outstanding tasks, ensuring that they stay on track and meet their obligations.</p>
<p>The campaign can be manned, enabling customers to speak to an agent as soon as they receive the call (predictive dialling) or unmanned(progressive dialling), presenting them with a spread of options for follow-up and further communication.</p>
<p>Configuration options include call scheduling by working hours, contacts’ data objects and event triggers, as well as selection of an appropriate Call Identifier to improve call acceptance rate.</p>
<h2>How to Set Up a Predictive Outbound Campaign in Amazon Connect</h2>
<p>1. Upload a CSV File to Amazon S3; this contains the necessary details for each customer targeted by the campaign, including their phone number and email address.</p>
<p>2. The CSV File is picked up by the Campaign CSV Processor Lambda Function, which uploads the necessary information to Amazon DynamoDB and an Amazon Pinpoint segment.</p>
<p>3. A campaign Administrator creates a Journey in Amazon PinPoint, and publishes using the segment created in the previous step.</p>
<p>4. Amazon Connect dials out to the customer. The contact flow that is used for the outbound dial leverages Answering Machine Detection(AMD) to inform the next action.</p>
<p>5. If the call is answered, the customer is informed that they have some outstanding actions. They are given the option to request an email containing the instructions required to complete the task, with an additional option to receive a text message reminder in the short future. The customer may also request to speak to a member of the team; in this case, the customer is placed into a queue to be handled by the next available agent.</p>
<p>6. If the customer requests instructions via email, Amazon Connect invokes the Send Email Instructions Lambda Function. This looks up the customer’s phone number in the Campaign Table, where the customer’s email address can be found.</p>
<p>7. At this point, an email is sent to the customer via the Simple Email Service (SES) API.</p>
<p>8. If the customer requests a text message reminder in the short future, Amazon Connect invokes the Schedule Text Reminder function which uses the customer’s phone number to update their record in the Campaign Table, adding an attribute 'TextReminderDate' with a date XX number of days from today. (NB. The number of days in the future can be configured within the Schedule Text Reminder environment variables, or the function can be extended to allow the customer to choose the number of days.)</p>
<p>9. Once a day, Amazon EventBridge invokes the Send TextReminder Lambda function, using an EventBridge Rule on a schedule.</p>
<p>10. The Send Text Reminder function performs a scan on the Campaign Table and filters the records that have a reminder scheduled for that day’s date.</p>
<p>11. Finally, the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is leveraged to send a text message reminder to each customer via the SNS API.</p>
<p>This is just one of the multiple, automated outbound campaign options available with Amazon Connect.

Both models offer unique benefits depending on the scale, usage patterns, and business goals of your contact centre. Here, we'll break down these options and why each might fit into your contact centre strategy. If you're exploring Amazon Connect as a potential solution, this guide will provide you with a foundational understanding to make an informed decision without needing in-depth technical knowledge.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4>A Quick Look at Traditional Billing Models</h4>
<p>Historically, contact centres have often operated on a subscription basis, where businesses pay a fixed, per-user fee each month. This model simplifies budgeting but doesn’t always offer flexibility, especially for businesses with fluctuating call volumes. This is where Amazon Connect’s approach introduced a breath of fresh air, breaking away from the traditional subscription model to enable flexible consumption-based billing.</p>
<h4>Understanding Amazon Connect’s Two Pricing Models</h4>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Consumption-Based Billing</strong></span><br>Amazon Connect’s original billing model is consumption-based, meaning you only pay for what you use. If your contact centre has peak call volumes in some months and lower usage in others, you’ll benefit from only paying for actual usage rather than a flat, ongoing fee. This model is particularly attractive to organisations with seasonally fluctuating contact centre demands. In Amazon Connect’s consumption model:
<ul>
<li>Costs are incurred per call, chat, or customer interaction.</li>
<li>Charges apply per action, such as per minute of call time or per chat session.</li>
<li>If your contact centre sees a low volume of calls in a given month, your costs will reflect that reduced usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Subscription-Based Billing</strong></span><br>Recently, Amazon Connect introduced subscription-based pricing for select premium features. This change reflects a shift for certain services that are more complex, such as <strong>forecasting and scheduling</strong> or <strong>evaluation forms</strong>. These features are billed per user per month once activated, offering a predictable monthly fee for organisations leveraging advanced functionalities.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Breaking Down Key Subscription Features</h4>
<p>Amazon Connect’s premium features offer advanced functionality but come with a different pricing structure than the core consumption model. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Forecasting and Scheduling</strong></span><br>For contact centres that need detailed workforce planning, forecasting and scheduling tools are crucial. Amazon Connect’s scheduling solution integrates seamlessly with agent activity, making real-time adjustments based on demand. This feature is subscription-based, with a monthly fee per active user, ensuring that forecasting and scheduling are accurate and available without fluctuating daily costs.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Evaluation Forms</strong></span><br>Quality monitoring and evaluation are essential for maintaining high standards. Amazon Connect allows managers to assess agent interactions using customisable evaluation forms. This functionality is billed per evaluated agent per month, making it cost-effective if your contact centre is committed to systematic performance tracking.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>AI and Amazon Q</strong></span><br>Amazon Connect’s AI-driven assistant, Amazon Q, leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide real-time support and guidance to agents. This feature also follows a subscription model and is billed per agent per month. AI integration can be costly to operate in a purely consumption-based model due to backend processes needed to keep the system up to date, so a subscription approach provides cost predictability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How These Models Benefit Your Contact Centre</h4>
<p>Each model has its own advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Consumption-Based Billing</strong></span> is ideal for:
<ul>
<li>Contact centres with fluctuating or seasonal usage.</li>
<li>Businesses wanting a lower barrier to entry, allowing them to scale usage based on actual customer demand.</li>
<li>Proof of concept (PoC) testing, where you can experiment with Amazon Connect on a limited scale before committing to larger rollouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Subscription-Based Billing</strong></span> works well for:
<ul>
<li>Organisations with stable, consistent agent requirements.</li>
<li>Those leveraging Amazon Connect’s advanced, feature-rich capabilities for forecasting, evaluation, and AI tools.</li>
<li>Companies looking for predictable monthly costs in certain functionalities, particularly if AI-driven insights and performance metrics are critical to operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Future of Amazon Connect Billing</h4>
<p>With Amazon Connect’s new features, subscription-based billing can give businesses peace of mind by offering a capped cost for high-end functionality. With contact centres evolving rapidly, it’s clear why certain advanced features are moving to a subscription model. For Amazon Connect users, this approach simplifies budgeting, allowing businesses to better plan around specific needs.</p>
<h4>Tips to Optimise Your Amazon Connect Spend</h4>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Selective POCs for Premium Features</strong></span><br>For businesses new to Amazon Connect, conducting smaller proof-of-concept trial on advanced features like forecasting and scheduling or Amazon Q is advisable. Activating premium features for a select group of agents helps control costs while testing the feature’s value.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Utilise Security Groups</strong></span><br>By configuring security groups, you can control access to specific features, such as restricting Amazon Q or scheduling tools to designated teams. This setup ensures that only authorised agents use these features, managing costs effectively.</li>
<li><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Leverage Amazon’s Cost Calculators</strong></span><br>Amazon offers cost calculator tools that can help you estimate monthly spending based on expected usage. Using these calculators, especially when configuring complex services, can give you insights into how different configurations affect overall spend.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Navigating Amazon Connect’s billing options may seem complex at first, but understanding the distinctions between consumption-based and subscription-based pricing empowers you to make informed decisions. By leveraging Amazon Connect’s flexible consumption model, or opting for the predictability of subscription billing for advanced features, you can tailor your contact centre setup to your business’s needs. Whether you need the flexibility to adjust costs month-by-month or prefer the peace of mind that comes with fixed monthly expenses, Amazon Connect offers adaptable solutions to help you optimise contact centre performance.</p>

<p>In this episode Tom &amp; Alex were joined by Bentley Paton - Platform Engineer at CloudInteract - to discuss some of the newest innovations in the Amazon Connect communications widget.We first discuss the existing chat widget capabilities that Connect has had for some time before moving to talk about the addition of audio and video. We spent some time talking about whether the world was ready for this - both customers and companies.After that, we headed into the technicalities of how everything worked, how to configure the widget for various different outcomes, and discussed the cost model. Next week, we are joined by John Ing, an independent Cloud Contact Centre Consultant. As an early adopter of Amazon Connect who led the first UK Bank onto Amazon Connect five years ago he has many stories to share, so be sure you don't miss this one!</p>

<p>In this podcast episode, Tom Morgan and Alex Baker discuss how to set up and manage an Amazon Connect Contact Centre. They highlight the importance of planning before starting the deployment process and determining how exactly you want to use Amazon Connect.</p>
<p>Alex states the importance of understanding the technical side of things and emphasizing the need for proof of concept which involves proving the technology, getting staff to use it, and checking if the business case makes sense.</p>
<p>The hosts then discuss the feasibility of a lift and shift approach to transformation, where all processes from the legacy system are lifted and moved to the new system. Alex suggests considering the transformation in two phases – an initial lift and shift phase to meet strict deadlines, and then a phase to optimize and take full advantage of the capabilities of the new platform.</p>
<p>They talk about the benefits of setting up a sandbox or development environment where you can test out new ideas, keeping in mind the costs of running multiple contact centres for a certain duration, and the importance of training staff to be self-sufficient in using and optimizing the Amazon Connect contact centre.</p>
<p>The podcast covers the topic of migration in depth and is focused on the practical steps of setting up, transitioning, and managing a new Amazon Connect Contact Centre.</p>

<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: Aileron; font-weight: 300; color: #c63db5;"">Understanding the Challenges of Legacy Systems</span></h3>
<p>Today, many contact centres remain stuck in the past—relying on fragmented systems that are not equipped to meet the expectations of today’s multi-channel, data-driven customer service. These outdated platforms are voice-centric, with limited capabilities for automation or integrated reporting. This not only stifles innovation but also leaves businesses disconnected from their customers.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that CX transformation is more than just upgrading technology. It’s about evolving the way your contact centre operates, so it can respond to changing customer needs with greater agility and efficiency.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_1.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most organisations begin their journey at this stage, where they operate with basic, often disjointed systems and minimal reporting capabilities. Customer interactions are reactive, and businesses focus heavily on managing costs rather than fostering innovation. The lack of integrated tools leads to a fragmented customer experience, with IT and business teams working in silos.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparate Systems:</strong> Multiple disconnected tools result in inconsistent service and limit the ability to innovate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Customer Insights:</strong> Without integrated systems, businesses struggle to gather and analyse data, leaving them without the insights necessary to deliver proactive service.</li>
<li><strong>High Dependency on Agents:</strong> Manual handling of customer interactions leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased agent burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By streamlining your infrastructure and integrating systems, you can overcome these challenges. This shift provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer data</strong> for deeper insights.</li>
<li><strong>Operational efficiencies</strong> by reducing manual workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time reporting</strong> for faster decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_2.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, organisations begin to realise the benefits of modern platforms. Moving to the cloud allows for greater flexibility, more connected systems, and the ability to generate real-time insights that can drive smarter decision-making. Automation begins to take hold, helping to streamline routine tasks and reduce the burden on agents.</p>
<p>Consider a recent example of a global healthcare company we worked with. They were heavily reliant on a legacy system, which cost millions annually and supported only voice interactions. Their challenge was to transition 1,000 agents to the cloud in under five months—while maintaining business continuity. Through a well-structured plan and leveraging cloud technologies, we helped them meet this tight deadline, dramatically cutting costs and vastly improving the system's flexibility.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocking the Full Potential of Data:</strong> While systems may be more connected, businesses often lack the tools or expertise to make data actionable. Many miss opportunities to leverage automation effectively, which limits operational improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Manual and Automated Processes:</strong> As businesses begin automating tasks, it’s common for agents to still handle processes that could be automated, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By integrating systems and automating key processes like call summarisation and reporting, you can unlock the full potential of your data. This not only reduces operational costs but also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more accurate service</strong> through real-time data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Automation of repetitive tasks</strong>, freeing up agents to focus on more complex customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_3.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_3"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, the focus shifts to highly automated workflows powered by AI. With AI-enabled reporting and advanced system integration, contact centres can handle customer interactions more efficiently, reducing the need for manual agent intervention by up to 80%. This frees agents to focus on higher-value tasks that require human empathy and expertise.</p>
<p>For example, we worked with a professional services organisation that moved to cloud-based operations. After analysing thousands of customer interactions, they identified inefficiencies—like high call abandonment rates—that had previously gone unnoticed. With these insights, they rapidly implemented improvements that significantly enhanced both customer satisfaction and operational performance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining the Balance Between Automation and Human Service:</strong> As automation increases, there’s a risk of losing the personal touch. It’s crucial to ensure that automation enhances, rather than replaces, the human empathy needed for complex cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value:</strong> AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Without proper data and processes, businesses risk deploying ineffective solutions that fail to improve customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By refining your automation processes and empowering agents with AI-driven insights, you can improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The right balance of AI and human touch can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance service speed and accuracy</strong>, delivering a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support agents</strong> in managing complex interactions, allowing them to excel where human intuition and problem-solving are needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final stage of the CX Maturity Journey envisions a fully integrated, AI-powered contact centre that proactively meets customer needs across all channels. In this future-ready environment, AI-driven systems predict and automate up to 90% of customer interactions, allowing human agents to focus on high-touch, complex cases that require empathy and expertise. This balance ensures that your customers receive the best of both worlds—efficient, automated support for simple requests and personalised, human service when it matters most.</p>
<p>A crucial element in this stage is ensuring that automation feels personal, not robotic. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can anticipate customer needs, offering tailored solutions in real time. This level of proactive support doesn’t just meet customer expectations—it exceeds them, creating deeper connections and fostering loyalty.</p>

Recently, I experienced such a scenario first-hand when I called my broadband provider to resolve an issue with my service.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Then comes the survey – a simple question asking how likely I was to recommend the company to a friend or colleague. Given my experience, my answer was a resounding “Not at all.” This moment of dissatisfaction drove home the importance of understanding and acting on customer feedback. It's not just about resolving issues; it's about creating an experience that leaves customers feeling valued and understood.</p>

<h3>The Power of NPS</h3>
<p>The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a powerful tool that measures customer loyalty and satisfaction. By asking customers to rate their likelihood of recommending your business on a scale of 0 to 10, you can categorise them into Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), and Detractors (0-6). This simple metric provides deep insights into customer sentiment and loyalty.</p>
<p>But collecting NPS data is only the first step. To truly leverage its power, businesses need to transform these insights into actionable improvements. This is where the Amazon Connect NPS dashboard, visualised by CloudInteract, becomes an invaluable asset.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Amazon Connect NPS dashboard is designed to help businesses not just capture customer feedback, but also act on it. Here’s how it can transform your customer service operations:</p>
<p><strong>Holistic View of Customer Sentiment</strong>: The dashboard provides a high-level overview of your NPS, showing trends over time. This allows managers to quickly identify whether customer sentiment is improving or declining and take proactive steps accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Agent Performance</strong>: By breaking down NPS scores by individual agents, the dashboard highlights who is excelling and who may need additional training. This granularity helps managers provide tailored coaching and support, improving overall service quality.</p>
<p><strong>Queue Analysis</strong>: Different service queues may have different NPS results. The dashboard analyses these variations, helping managers pinpoint areas that need attention and understand where improvements can be made.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Journey Insights</strong>: The dashboard tracks how customers move through the service process and where they are likely to become Detractors. This helps businesses refine their service flows to reduce friction and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3>The Dashboard in Action</h3>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the features of the Amazon Connect NPS dashboard using the detailed visual provided by CloudInteract:</p>
<p>Overall NPS Score and Trends: The main metric shows the current NPS and how it has trended over the selected period. For example, you can see if your score is improving or if there are times when customer sentiment dips, allowing you to investigate and address issues promptly.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Metrics</strong>: Key statistics such as the number of surveys offered, started, and completed are displayed prominently. This data is essential for understanding customer engagement with the surveys and ensuring you have enough responses to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Agent-Specific Data</strong>: The dashboard lists individual agents along with their respective survey offers, starts, and completions. It also provides average scores, helping managers identify high and low performers and understand the factors driving these results. Additionally, CloudInteract enhances understanding with call recordings and transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Queue Analysis</strong>: Surveys are broken down by queue, showing the number of surveys offered, started, and completed for each. This helps in identifying which areas of the business might be causing customer dissatisfaction and require more focus.</p>
<p><strong>Question-Specific Feedback</strong>: The dashboard provides detailed insights into specific questions, showing average scores for each. This helps businesses understand which aspects of their service are performing well and which need improvement.</p>

We'll explore how to pass contextual information effectively and employ Step-by-step Guides to streamline processes and enrich experiences for both parties.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><blockquote>
<p>Authored by Bentley Paton | AWS Connect Architect at CloudInteract</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is an example of how these features can be leveraged, and this blog will provide you with all that you need to achieve this.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer View</strong></h3>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66741639e41991de97be5ef5_Picture%201.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""497"" height=""600""></div>
</figure>
<p>By passing contextual information, we're able to surface details and collect input from customers using Step-by-step guides. In this blog, we'll use the example of an Estate Agents. &nbsp;In the customer view showcased here, context has been passed to the Communications Widget regarding the property they're contacting about. This information is presented to the customer, allowing them to review the details and provide a reason for their enquiry.</p>
<h3><strong>Agent View</strong></h3>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/667417bf0980943dd91800af_Picture%202.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""616"" height=""464""></div>
</figure>
<p>The same information is surfaced to the Agent along with additional details about the seller of the property and the customer’s chosen Enquiry Reason. The customer's name is also captured, which will be later in this blog.</p>
<h3><strong>Passing Context with Amazon Connect:</strong></h3>
<p>Context is key to fostering meaningful interactions between customers and agents. By passing context parameters through the Amazon Connect Communications Widget, you can enrich interactions with relevant information before the customer has exchanged words with an agent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of contextual data could include the type of device, reason for contact, customer details, preferences, etc.</p>
<p>This approach empowers agents to address customer queries promptly, eliminates the need for redundant inquiries, and tailors responses to provide personalised assistance, enhancing the overall customer experience. Ultimately, context leads to more efficient and satisfying interactions for both parties.</p>
<p>Recently, AWS introduced support for Step-by-step Guides for customers in live chat, enabling the presentation of rich, interactive pages or workflows within the chat interface. This addition enhances self-service capabilities, thereby boosting efficiency and improving the experience for both customers and agents. I'll demonstrate how this feature can leverage context provided to the Communications Widget to surface relevant information to both customers and agents. The context shared and gathered during interactions can be utilised to set contact attributes and tag the contact with valuable insights, enabling a deeper understanding of customer behaviour, preferences, and more. Leveraging these insights enables informed decision-making, process optimization, and enhanced customer experience.</p>
<h3>‍<strong>Hands-on:</strong></h3>
<p>For this demonstration, let's consider a fictional Estate Agents scenario to illustrate how to implement these features. If you haven't set up the Amazon Connect Communications Widget yet, you can follow the setup instructions provided in my previous blog post to get started in less than 10 minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When contacting an estate agent, customers often need to provide their identity, specify the property of interest, and state the reason for reaching out. Let's streamline this process by leveraging a simple QR Code as the initiation method. Estate agents often provide print outs, leaflets or brochures, where a ‘Contact Us’ QR Code could be very easily included.</p>
<p>I’ve started with a simple DynamoDB table to mock the estate agent’s backend to store property details.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class=""w-code-block"" style=""display: block; overflow-x: auto; background: #2b2b2b; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 0.5em;"" contenteditable=""false""><code class=""language-javascript"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span>{  
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""property_id""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""150804093""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""address""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""62 West Wallaby Street\nWigan\nWG7 7FU""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""description""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""3 Bedroom detatched house with no vendor chain""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""listing_url""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""https://cloudinteract-estates.io/150804093""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""list_price""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""£400,000""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""seller_first_name""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""Wallace""</span><span>, 
</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""seller_last_name""</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""G""</span><span> 
</span> } </code></pre>
<p>Using DynamoDB Streams and a Lambda Function, we'll automatically generate a QR Code for each property and upload it to an S3 bucket. The QR Code will navigate to the widget host URL while appending a query string parameter 'property_id'. Additionally, the Lambda Function will update the record to include the S3 bucket location for the QR Code.</p>
<p>Below is the function code I used to achieve this:</p>

<h3><strong>Amazon Connect Integration:</strong></h3>
<p>To pass contact attributes to the chat, we have two methods as outlined in the AWS documentation (<a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/pass-contact-attributes-chat.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/pass-contact-attributes-chat.html</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Method 1:</strong></h4>
<p>Simply add the attributes as a key value pair to your JavaScript snippet:</p>
<pre class=""w-code-block"" style=""display: block; overflow-x: auto; background: #2b2b2b; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 0.5em;"" contenteditable=""false""><code class=""language-javascript"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span>amazon_connect(</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">'contactAttributes'</span><span>, { 
</span><span>  </span><span class=""hljs-attr"">foo</span><span>: </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">'bar'</span><span> 
</span> }) </code></pre>
<h4><strong>Method 2:</strong></h4>
<p>Send the contact attributes to the widget using a JavaScript Web Token. In this blog, we'll use Method 2 and utilize URL Query String parameters to pass the 'property_id' corresponding to a house listing stored in our database. Below is an example implementation of this method into the widget script:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=""w-code-block"" style=""display: block; overflow-x: auto; background: #2b2b2b; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 0.5em;"" contenteditable=""false""><code class=""language-javascript"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span>amazon_connect(</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">'authenticate'</span><span>, </span><span class=""hljs-function"" style=""color: #dcc6e0;"">function</span><span class=""hljs-function"">(</span><span class=""hljs-function"" style=""color: #f5ab35;"">callback</span><span class=""hljs-function"">) </span><span>{

</span><span>  </span><span style=""color: #dcc6e0;"">const</span><span> propertyId = urlParams.get(property_id); 
</span><span>      </span><span style=""color: #f5ab35;"">window</span><span>.fetch(</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">'API_GATEWAY_URL, {

</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">          }, 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">          body: JSON.stringify({ property_id: propertyId }), 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      }) 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      .then(res =&gt; res.json()) 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      .then(data =&gt; { 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">          const responseBody = JSON.parse(data.body); 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">          callback(responseBody); 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      }) 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      .catch(error =&gt; { 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">          console.error('</span><span style=""color: #f5ab35;"">Error</span><span>:</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">', error); 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">      }); 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">  } 
</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">); </span></code></pre>
<p>This method ensures data integrity but requires additional setup steps compared to Method 1.</p>
<h5><strong>Extra Steps for Method 2:</strong></h5>
<p>1. In Amazon Connect, navigate to 'Communications Widgets' and select your widget.</p>
<p>2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, click 'Create a new security key', and copy the key. Follow appropriate security practices to secure the chat widget.</p>

</figure>
<p>3. Navigate to AWS Console &gt; Systems Manager &gt; Parameter Store and create a new parameter with an appropriate name and type 'SecureString' to encrypt the key.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66741cbb484152b90bc78cc1_Picture%205.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""736"" height=""663"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 736px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;""></div>
</figure>
<p>4. Set up an API Gateway and a Lambda Function to serve requests. Create a Lambda Function using Python 3.11 or higher. Below is an example Lambda function that takes the 'property_id' from a POST request and retrieves information from a DynamoDB table to be passed as contact attributes to the chat widget.</p>

<p>Now, when you open your Amazon Connect Communications Widget, the contact attributes should be associated with the contact, enabling personalized interactions.</p>
<h3><strong>Utilising Context in Amazon Connect:</strong></h3>
<p>Step-by-step guides or Custom Views in Amazon Connect offer a powerful toolset to enhance both the agent and customer experience. These features enable the presentation of information and collection of inputs without the need for bot configuration.</p>
<p>Let's start by surfacing property details to the customer and allowing them to select a reason for their inquiry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In your Contact Flow used for Inbound Chat communications, search for the 'Show View' block and add it to your flow. We'll use the 'Form' View type for this demonstration.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/66741edfbc0d2b515021fd58_Picture%2011.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""884"" height=""466""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>Configure the Sections field to define the UI components, headings, and values for your view using a JSON object. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is the configuration I’ve used to surface the Property Address, Description, List Price, and URL in a Data Section. Followed by a separate FormSection with a Dropdown menu with some pre-set Enquiry Reasons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The notation $.Attributes. tells Amazon Connect to fetch these values from the Contact Attributes – and so as we’ve passed these to the widget when the contact was started, Amazon Connect is already aware of this information.</p>

<p>What if we wanted to also capture the customer’s name before connecting them?</p>
<p>In your inbound chat flow, lets create another Show View block, so that we can ask their name after they’ve checked the property details. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Add that block in just before you route the customer to a queue.</p>
<p>In the Sections field, we’re going to add:</p>
<pre class=""w-code-block"" style=""display: block; overflow-x: auto; background: #2b2b2b; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 0.5em;"" contenteditable=""false""><code class=""language-javascript"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span>[

</span>            } 
       ] 
    } 
 ] </code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now after checking the property details, you should see a form asking the customer for their name.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/6674218258f5d4e09ddd4e0a_Picture%2017.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""682"" height=""816""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍</p>
<p>We can then add a ‘Set Contact Attributes’ block after the Show View – to set the Attribute ‘CustomerName’ to $.Views.ViewResultData.FormData.CustomerName</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/667421a261f0c5a40fd4f6b4_Picture%2018.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""504"" height=""342""></div>
</figure>
<p>‍Then to pull that through to the Agents view, we can go to the Event Flow – &nbsp;</p>
<p>And add the following to the ‘Customer Details’ list in the Sections field.</p>
<pre class=""w-code-block"" style=""display: block; overflow-x: auto; background: #2b2b2b; color: #f8f8f2; padding: 0.5em;"" contenteditable=""false""><code class=""language-javascript"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span>     { 
</span><span>            </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""Label""</span><span>:</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""Customer Name""</span><span>, 
</span><span>            </span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""Value""</span><span>:</span><span style=""color: #abe338;"">""$.Attributes.CustomerName""</span><span> 
</span>         } </code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the call is connected to an Agent, they will now see the Customer Name as well as the enquiry reason, allowing the Agent to greet by name for a more personal touch.</p>
<figure>
<div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/667421ccaa244410c454d18c_Picture%2019.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""904"" height=""680""></div>

<p>‍For further customization, you can add additional UI components, such as a Date Picker, to allow customers to select dates for booking viewings. Utilize the AWS Documentation and UI Component Viewer (<a href=""https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/story/overview--page"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/story/overview--page</a>) &nbsp;to build bespoke views tailored to your specific needs.</p>

AI will revolutionise our contact centres, creating more productive agents, happier customers and better bottom lines. Like any new technology, there’s a lot of uncertainty, a lot of unknowns and a good deal of snake oil. How are leaders supposed to know where to invest, what groundwork is needed, when to buy verses build?</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Cutting through the hype</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what we mean, by defining<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>AI will be used in contact centres. After all, AI is merely the name we give to the technology before we’ve worked out what to do with it.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this blog, we're going to talk about creating solutions that assist agents with answering customer queries, by presenting them relevant information, crafting replies, summarising conversations etc. This same approach could be used to answer customer queries directly but there is considerable angst about doing this with the current state of the technology. Instead, agents can act as a filter and quality gate, processing the information being given to them and relaying it to the customer. This is also a good way to train any AI models for any potential future “direct to customer” application.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is that agents don’t need to spend time researching or finding answers to questions or producing well-crafted literary prose for communications. They can, instead, focus on ensuring that the information being presented is correct and that customer questions are being answered. Customers still engage with a human agent, but one who is better informed and faster to answer.</p>
<p>The downside is that there is a risk that agents will become over-dependant on the system feeding them information and will fail to perform their checking function to prevent erroneous or incomprehensible information being delivered to customers.</p>
<p>If we wanted to build such a system, what “AI parts” do we need, how do they work, and how do we combine them? I believe that if leaders have a basic understanding of the technology that underpins what we currently call “Generative AI” then they will be in a better position to make decisions on how best to apply it to their organisation.</p>
<h3>101 – How LLMs really work</h3>
<p>If you and I met for coffee and, as we got up to leave I said, “See you later, alligator”, what would you say? &nbsp;Chances are high you would reply with the correct finish to that sentence, “In a while, crocodile”.</p>
<p>If a coworker greets you with “First come, first…”, you will probably reply “…served!”, whilst wondering if you’d missed out on morning snacks.</p>
<p>This works because we’ve learnt these common phrases and so we know that they are the most likely endings to the sentence that was started. There’s nothing grammatically incorrect about the sentence “First come, first disappointed”; it’s just not a very likely sentence.</p>
<p>To express this concept in mathematical terms, we can complete sentences by using the most probable answer: the one with the highest probability.</p>
<p>This is how Large Language Models (LLMs) work. Imagine a database of all the words, parts of words, sentences and phrases you know and their relationships to each other. Each one would have a probability associated with it. Some would be high (such as the relationship between “first come” and “first served”), others less so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Generative AI uses these LLMs to complete whatever input it’s been given. So, in a very simple example (using Amazon Bedrock and the Titan Text G1 – Premier LLM):</p>
<figure>
<div><img alt=""A close-up of a white rectangular objectDescription automatically generated"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/666ad431a2dd970e1461156b_8dc16a92.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1438"" height=""227""></div>
</figure>
<p>A LLM isn’t smart, or magic, or reasoning over what you say. All it wants to do is complete the input it’s been given.</p>
<figure>
<div><img alt=""A close-up of a computer screenDescription automatically generated"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/666ad4402bc41bb2eadc9f3a_d494e325.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1430"" height=""234""></div>
</figure>
<p>When we scale this up to more complex examples, the same rules hold true, but at scale.</p>
<p>What actually happens is that the Generative AI system will produce one word at a time, based on probability, and then feed that back into the model to generate the second word. For example, for an input “Generate a haiku about cheese”, the actual inputs fed into the LLM, and the output would be:</p>
<div>
<div>
<table style=""border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid #99acc2;"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese</td>
<td>Soft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft</td>
<td>Soft and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft and</td>
<td>Soft and Creamy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft and Creamy,</td>
<td>Soft and Creamy, with</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft and Creamy, with</td>
<td>Soft and Creamy, with a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft and Creamy, with a</td>
<td>Soft and Creamy, with a rind</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate a haiku about cheese: Soft and Creamy, with a rind</td>
<td>Soft and Creamy, with a rind that’s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>…and so on.</p>
<p>This also works at the conversation level. When you have a conversation with an LLM-backed AI system, every message you send also includes the full conversation history up until that point. That’s how the system “knows” the context: it’s being given the full conversation history each time.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember here is that all the information is contained within the LLM, and all answers come from there. It takes a huge amount of time and resources to produce these models and so they are “stuck” at a point in time when they were trained, like talking to a ghost from a particular time in the past. They also don’t know anything about how your contact centre runs or how to answer any specific questions about your products. We’ll address both points next.</p>
<h3>What RAG is and how it works</h3>
<p>Let’s ask our model about Eurovision:</p>
<figure>
<div><img alt=""A screen shot of a computer screenDescription automatically generated"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/666ad503132da3131c45ae93_4e88b79a.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1431"" height=""246""></div>
</figure>
<p>The problem here is that we are asking this question in 2024 but the model was trained in 2023. It is “stuck in time” and has no knowledge past that point.</p>

</figure>
<p>Remembering what we know about how Generative AI works by trying to complete inputs based on the most probable next work, let’s modify our input prompt. We’re going to tell it who won, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ask it.</p>

<p>Surprised? Underwhelmed? By providing additional relevant information, we can improve our answers. This is the essence of Resource Augmented Generation (RAG), albeit on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>The simplest way to think about RAG is that the system performs a search in real-time against a pre-configured database and uses those results as part of the input. Usually, the database needs to be in a very specific format so that searching uses the input provided generates good results and can then return just the relevant records (a similar technology to how LLM probability works – these databases store vectors that implement Approximate Nearest Neighbour algorithms). The databases are called vector databases (or vector search databases) and can contain document references, website references, or traditional database data.</p>
<p>When a user asks a question or provides other input, a search is made of this data store using that input. Any results are then fed back, as part of the input to the model, in a similar way that I fed in the information about the 2024 Eurovision winner.</p>
<p>This means that answers are more likely to be correct, will be as up to date as the source data is, and can be tightly scoped to the problem domain you are trying to solve for. It is possible in the prompt to ensure that only data returned from the RAG search is used in the generation of an answer rather than any generic data from in the LLM which may not be accurate or relevant to the question.‍</p>
<h3>Applying LLMs and RAG to the Contact Centre</h3>
<p>The adage is true: garbage in, garbage out. The successfulness of any RAG-based model is directly related to how complete and accurate the data is. Regardless of which vendor you choose or what your solution looks like, making sure you are compiling and maintaining an up-to-date repository of the “knowledge” in your contact centre is one of the most important things you can be doing today.</p>
<p>When we work with customer experience teams (and we like to get involved on the floor, talking to agents, sitting beside them through their day to understand how they work) we see this knowledge in all sorts of places: training materials, how-to guides, notepads, sticky notes, word of mouth etc. One of the first tasks is to ensure that this knowledge is captured, categorized and stored.</p>
<p>Only then we can start to represent this knowledge as a vector search database and begin working with the business on what interacting with this might look like. It’s a very iterative process that involves analysing the types of questions agents receive, and where they go to answer them. Once we’re ready we slowly start to suggest answers to agents, collecting their feedback as we go to help us improve the experience of both the data and when it is offered.</p>
<p>We can also use this approach to help agents to produce content, not just assist in answering questions. Sometimes we will combine information from several places, such as in this example:</p>
<p>In an omni-channel contact centre, an agent is reviewing an inbound email requesting a cancellation. The agent asks the system to draft an email response by clicking a button in their custom email client labelled “Draft AI Reply”. Using the body of the email as a search input to a vector search database the correct policy information is retrieved. This is then used, along with the original email, as input to create a response.</p>
<p>Actual input used to model (not shown to agent):</p>
<p><em>Information from the company policies and guidelines: ""...general, holidays may be cancelled up to 14 days in advance with no penalty. Holidays cancelled after this time incur 50% penalty. Any refunds can take up to 14 days to be returned to the customer's bank account. For escalations or further questions, contact your Team Leader...""</em></p>
<p><em>The human agent's name is Tom Morgan and his job title is Customer Advisor, InterConnect Experiences. Draft a professional and courteous email response to the email, as if it were from the human agent and which answers the email based on the company policies and guidelines. The email subject is 'Cancellation of Booking ID #45321'. The email body is: 'Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, I need to cancel my booking for the Tuscan Cooking Experience scheduled for August 2024. My booking ID is #45321. Could you please guide me through the cancellation process and let me know about any applicable refunds? Thank you for your assistance, Alexis'</em></p>

</figure>
<h3>Choosing an LLM</h3>
<p>The choice of Large Language Model can make a significant difference to the quality of responses. The amount and quality of source data used to train the model both play a part in determining what the output looks like. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own models, using only data you specify; however, this is a costly and resource-intensive process. Unless you have a very large amount of source data and a desire to create content that matches the style of existing content very closely, it will be necessary for you to choose one of the vendor-provided LLMs.</p>
<p>Things to consider when choosing a model include token size (how big can the inputs and outputs be), cost and intended usage. There are comparison tools out there to help you decide, but I’ve found that a good way to decide is just to try out a few and get a feel for the quality of the answers you’re being presented with, based on sample questions that match your intended use case.</p>
<p>Amazon Bedrock can be a helpful tool for performing this exercise. Bedrock provides access to over 30 different models from a variety of providers, plus a Chat Playground to let you quickly try them out. New models are being added all the time, so it’s worth checking back regularly. If you prefer to use Microsoft technology, Azure AI Studio provides a similar Model catalog with a different (and larger) collection of models.</p>
<figure>
<div><img alt=""A screenshot of a computerDescription automatically generated"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/666ad549911a07e0e1de8215_71f821e7.png"" loading=""lazy"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""914"" height=""702""></div>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply chose your model, and you’ll be presented with a chat interface, together with some sample prompts if you’re not sure where to start. You can configure some settings that control how the model behaves. The most impactful of these is Temperature. Thinking back to the explanation of how a LLM works, increasing the temperature means that the model will choose results from a lower probability. Set the temperature to 0.5 and word matches will only need to score 50% and above to be included for selection, resulting in a more creative but possibly less understandable result. Set the temperature to 0 and only 100% probability matches will be returned, resulting in more formulaic answers.</p>
<h3>Why Pricing is Hard</h3>
<p>It can be hard to accurately predict the cost of using LLMs, and even harder to explain why it’s so hard. Pricing is based on consumption, but not on usual metrics such as number of questions asked.</p>
<p>Instead, pricing is based on tokens. To fully understand this, we need to revisit our original explanation of how LLMs work and correct some oversimplifications.</p>
<p>LLMs don’t actually store the relationships between words and phrases, they store the relationships between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tokens</em>. A token is a common sequence of characters, which might be a word or might be part of a word.</p>
<figure>
<div><img alt=""A close up of a logoDescription automatically generated"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e4ef0e836949668d5d81f6/666ad56463a3b0aba3f885d7_0a57592c.png"" loading=""lazy"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"" width=""723"" height=""126""></div>
</figure>
<p>In this example, 8 tokens were used to construct the sentence. For pricing estimates, a good rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to 0.75 word in the English language (100 tokens = 75 words). Tokens are counted both on the way in (input tokens) and in the answers given (output tokens).</p>
<p>For the model we’ve been using in this article (Amazon Titan Text Premier), the maximum number of tokens (both directions combined) is 32,000. That sounds like a lot, until you remember that needs to include both conversation history and any information from RAG. At the time of writing this, pricing for this model is $0.0005 per 1000 input tokens and $0.0015 per output tokens.</p>
<p>To predict the cost, it is necessary to estimate the likely length of both question and answer, how long each conversation might be, and how much RAG information is likely to be appended, then calculate the input and output cost of the conversation, before scaling up to the number of likely conversations.</p>
<p>Changing the model will change the pricing but may also change the behaviour: a different model may provider longer or shorter answers or require more or less input information to arrive at a suitable answer. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Both LLMs and RAG can have a significant positive impact on agent experience in contact centre, but only if implemented properly and considerately. Without knowing the fundamentals of how they work, leaders cannot make informed choices about how to move forward with their AI strategy. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color: #7d55c7;""><strong>Welcome to <em>Tech Talk: Cutting Through the Hype</em></strong></span><br>In this series, I'll lift the lid on the hype and cut through the hyperbole surrounding the technologies they claim will revolutionise our industry.</p>
<p>But let's be real: not everything that glitters is gold. Each post will cut through the noise and give you the straight talk you need to make informed decisions for your organisation. Expect no jargon - just honest insights, practical advice, and a clear look at what’s worth your time and investment in the tech landscape. Let’s separate fact from fiction and get to the heart of what really matters.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">The Future of Contact Centres: Why AI Isn’t Magic, But It Can Be a Game-Changer</span></h3>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight: AI isn’t some magic button you press to solve all your problems overnight. I’ve been around long enough to know that every shiny new tech promises the world, but the reality is often far less glamorous. Sure, Generative AI has the potential to transform customer service, but it’s not going to replace everything you have in place by tomorrow morning. If you’re expecting that, you’ll be disappointed. The key here is building a solid foundation first — laying the groundwork that allows AI to do what it does best, gradually, based on real data.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">Start Where You Are, Not Where You Want to Be</span></h3>
<p>Businesses I speak with worry that embracing AI means scrapping everything they’ve worked to build. I get it. There’s a lot of fear out there about rushing into something before you’re ready. It reminds me of the early days of unified communications when everyone thought we’d all be wearing headsets 24/7. That didn’t happen overnight either, did it?</p>
<p>The fact is, most contact centres today are still voice-driven. Your agents are handling calls, your customers are comfortable with the way things work (mostly), and that’s okay. You don’t need to tear everything down to move forward. What we do at CloudInteract is take what you’ve got — those voice systems that are still doing the heavy lifting - and build on them. AI isn’t about replacing; it’s about enhancing. You need to start by understanding what’s happening today before you start automating everything tomorrow.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">Data First, AI Later</span></h3>
<p>Here’s the thing: AI is only as good as the data you feed it. So before you get carried away with ideas of AI-driven customer interactions and fully automated workflows, you need to start by analysing what’s really going on in your contact centre. Look at your call data. What are your agents dealing with day in and day out? Where are the repetitive tasks? Are your customers getting stuck in self-service loops or needing human intervention more often than you think?</p>
<p>That’s where we come in. We can take your existing call data - everything from how long people are on hold to how many times they transfer to a live agent - and start to make sense of it. From there, we can figure out where AI would actually make an impact. Maybe it’s automating responses for simple enquiries, or maybe it’s something more complex. But the point is, we don’t know until we look at the data.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">The AI Utopia Can Wait</span></h3>
<p>Everyone likes to talk about the potential of AI to revolutionise customer service, and while that future is exciting, it’s not today. AI is not a teleportation device that magically zaps you into a fully autonomous world. It’s a tool that helps you get there one step at a time. That’s why our approach is to work with the systems you already have in place, integrating AI where it makes sense, not where it sounds cool.</p>
<p>Think of it like a diagnostic tool. You wouldn’t try to fix something without first understanding the problem, would you? AI can help you analyse your current operations and identify the best opportunities for improvement. It’s not about <em>replacing</em> your agents; it’s about <strong>supporting</strong> them, offering real-time insights, automating the mundane stuff, and giving them the tools to perform at their best.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">The Real World Benefits of AI – When Used Correctly</span></h3>
<p>When implemented thoughtfully, Generative AI can drive significant improvements in your contact centre. McKinsey’s research shows it can increase productivity by up to 45% in customer service functions. But that’s not the whole story. The true value comes from personalised, efficient interactions that make your customers feel heard and valued. It’s about resolving issues faster and giving your agents the support they need to excel.</p>
<p>But again, all of this starts with a foundation - understanding where you are today, analysing the data, and moving forward strategically. AI isn’t about jumping ahead; it’s about smart, incremental improvements that make a real difference to your business.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #cf389a;"">My Final Thoughts…</span></h3>
<p>If you’re nervous about AI, you’re not alone. But don’t let that fear stop you from exploring its potential. We’ll help you bring your current systems into the future, one step at a time, and ensure that you’re making decisions based on what’s really happening in your contact centre. No hype, just a data-driven approach to making your operations smoother and more efficient. And yes, if you’re wondering, it’s possible to do all this without turning your world upside down.</p>

<p>In this blog, Simon will guide you through the evolving landscape of customer experience (CX), addressing the common challenges contact centres face when moving away from legacy infrastructure. We’ll also introduce you to our <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">CX Maturity Journey</span>, a proven roadmap designed to help organisations transition from outdated, reactive systems to intelligent, AI-powered platforms capable of delivering proactive, personalised customer service.</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CX-and-Journey-Diagram.png"" width=""1760"" height=""1241"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CX-and-Journey-Diagram"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1760px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: Aileron; font-weight: 300; color: #c63db5;"">Understanding the Challenges of Legacy Systems</span></h3>
<p>Today, many contact centres remain stuck in the past—relying on fragmented systems that are not equipped to meet the expectations of today’s multi-channel, data-driven customer service. These outdated platforms are voice-centric, with limited capabilities for automation or integrated reporting. This not only stifles innovation but also leaves businesses disconnected from their customers.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that CX transformation is more than just upgrading technology. It’s about evolving the way your contact centre operates, so it can respond to changing customer needs with greater agility and efficiency.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_1.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most organisations begin their journey at this stage, where they operate with basic, often disjointed systems and minimal reporting capabilities. Customer interactions are reactive, and businesses focus heavily on managing costs rather than fostering innovation. The lack of integrated tools leads to a fragmented customer experience, with IT and business teams working in silos.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparate Systems:</strong> Multiple disconnected tools result in inconsistent service and limit the ability to innovate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Customer Insights:</strong> Without integrated systems, businesses struggle to gather and analyse data, leaving them without the insights necessary to deliver proactive service.</li>
<li><strong>High Dependency on Agents:</strong> Manual handling of customer interactions leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased agent burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By streamlining your infrastructure and integrating systems, you can overcome these challenges. This shift provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer data</strong> for deeper insights.</li>
<li><strong>Operational efficiencies</strong> by reducing manual workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time reporting</strong> for faster decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_2.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, organisations begin to realise the benefits of modern platforms. Moving to the cloud allows for greater flexibility, more connected systems, and the ability to generate real-time insights that can drive smarter decision-making. Automation begins to take hold, helping to streamline routine tasks and reduce the burden on agents.</p>
<p>Consider a recent example of a global healthcare company we worked with. They were heavily reliant on a legacy system, which cost millions annually and supported only voice interactions. Their challenge was to transition 1,000 agents to the cloud in under five months—while maintaining business continuity. Through a well-structured plan and leveraging cloud technologies, we helped them meet this tight deadline, dramatically cutting costs and vastly improving the system's flexibility.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocking the Full Potential of Data:</strong> While systems may be more connected, businesses often lack the tools or expertise to make data actionable. Many miss opportunities to leverage automation effectively, which limits operational improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Manual and Automated Processes:</strong> As businesses begin automating tasks, it’s common for agents to still handle processes that could be automated, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By integrating systems and automating key processes like call summarisation and reporting, you can unlock the full potential of your data. This not only reduces operational costs but also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more accurate service</strong> through real-time data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Automation of repetitive tasks</strong>, freeing up agents to focus on more complex customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_3.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_3"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, the focus shifts to highly automated workflows powered by AI. With AI-enabled reporting and advanced system integration, contact centres can handle customer interactions more efficiently, reducing the need for manual agent intervention by up to 80%. This frees agents to focus on higher-value tasks that require human empathy and expertise.</p>
<p>For example, we worked with a professional services organisation that moved to cloud-based operations. After analysing thousands of customer interactions, they identified inefficiencies—like high call abandonment rates—that had previously gone unnoticed. With these insights, they rapidly implemented improvements that significantly enhanced both customer satisfaction and operational performance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining the Balance Between Automation and Human Service:</strong> As automation increases, there’s a risk of losing the personal touch. It’s crucial to ensure that automation enhances, rather than replaces, the human empathy needed for complex cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value:</strong> AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Without proper data and processes, businesses risk deploying ineffective solutions that fail to improve customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By refining your automation processes and empowering agents with AI-driven insights, you can improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The right balance of AI and human touch can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance service speed and accuracy</strong>, delivering a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support agents</strong> in managing complex interactions, allowing them to excel where human intuition and problem-solving are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_4.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_4"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 4: The Art of the Possible</strong></span></h3>
<p>The final stage of the CX Maturity Journey envisions a fully integrated, AI-powered contact centre that proactively meets customer needs across all channels. In this future-ready environment, AI-driven systems predict and automate up to 90% of customer interactions, allowing human agents to focus on high-touch, complex cases that require empathy and expertise. This balance ensures that your customers receive the best of both worlds—efficient, automated support for simple requests and personalised, human service when it matters most.</p>
<p>A crucial element in this stage is ensuring that automation feels personal, not robotic. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can anticipate customer needs, offering tailored solutions in real time. This level of proactive support doesn’t just meet customer expectations—it exceeds them, creating deeper connections and fostering loyalty.</p>

This philosophy, championed by our co-founder and CEO Simon Leyland, drives everything we do as we help businesses reimagine their customer interactions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, Simon will guide you through the evolving landscape of customer experience (CX), addressing the common challenges contact centres face when moving away from legacy infrastructure. We’ll also introduce you to our <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">CX Maturity Journey</span>, a proven roadmap designed to help organisations transition from outdated, reactive systems to intelligent, AI-powered platforms capable of delivering proactive, personalised customer service.</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CX-and-Journey-Diagram.png"" width=""1760"" height=""1241"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CX-and-Journey-Diagram"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1760px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: Aileron; font-weight: 300; color: #c63db5;"">Understanding the Challenges of Legacy Systems</span></h3>
<p>Today, many contact centres remain stuck in the past—relying on fragmented systems that are not equipped to meet the expectations of today’s multi-channel, data-driven customer service. These outdated platforms are voice-centric, with limited capabilities for automation or integrated reporting. This not only stifles innovation but also leaves businesses disconnected from their customers.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that CX transformation is more than just upgrading technology. It’s about evolving the way your contact centre operates, so it can respond to changing customer needs with greater agility and efficiency.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_1.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most organisations begin their journey at this stage, where they operate with basic, often disjointed systems and minimal reporting capabilities. Customer interactions are reactive, and businesses focus heavily on managing costs rather than fostering innovation. The lack of integrated tools leads to a fragmented customer experience, with IT and business teams working in silos.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparate Systems:</strong> Multiple disconnected tools result in inconsistent service and limit the ability to innovate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Customer Insights:</strong> Without integrated systems, businesses struggle to gather and analyse data, leaving them without the insights necessary to deliver proactive service.</li>
<li><strong>High Dependency on Agents:</strong> Manual handling of customer interactions leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased agent burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By streamlining your infrastructure and integrating systems, you can overcome these challenges. This shift provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer data</strong> for deeper insights.</li>
<li><strong>Operational efficiencies</strong> by reducing manual workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time reporting</strong> for faster decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_2.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, organisations begin to realise the benefits of modern platforms. Moving to the cloud allows for greater flexibility, more connected systems, and the ability to generate real-time insights that can drive smarter decision-making. Automation begins to take hold, helping to streamline routine tasks and reduce the burden on agents.</p>
<p>Consider a recent example of a global healthcare company we worked with. They were heavily reliant on a legacy system, which cost millions annually and supported only voice interactions. Their challenge was to transition 1,000 agents to the cloud in under five months—while maintaining business continuity. Through a well-structured plan and leveraging cloud technologies, we helped them meet this tight deadline, dramatically cutting costs and vastly improving the system's flexibility.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocking the Full Potential of Data:</strong> While systems may be more connected, businesses often lack the tools or expertise to make data actionable. Many miss opportunities to leverage automation effectively, which limits operational improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Manual and Automated Processes:</strong> As businesses begin automating tasks, it’s common for agents to still handle processes that could be automated, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By integrating systems and automating key processes like call summarisation and reporting, you can unlock the full potential of your data. This not only reduces operational costs but also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more accurate service</strong> through real-time data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Automation of repetitive tasks</strong>, freeing up agents to focus on more complex customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_3.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_3"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, the focus shifts to highly automated workflows powered by AI. With AI-enabled reporting and advanced system integration, contact centres can handle customer interactions more efficiently, reducing the need for manual agent intervention by up to 80%. This frees agents to focus on higher-value tasks that require human empathy and expertise.</p>
<p>For example, we worked with a professional services organisation that moved to cloud-based operations. After analysing thousands of customer interactions, they identified inefficiencies—like high call abandonment rates—that had previously gone unnoticed. With these insights, they rapidly implemented improvements that significantly enhanced both customer satisfaction and operational performance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining the Balance Between Automation and Human Service:</strong> As automation increases, there’s a risk of losing the personal touch. It’s crucial to ensure that automation enhances, rather than replaces, the human empathy needed for complex cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value:</strong> AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Without proper data and processes, businesses risk deploying ineffective solutions that fail to improve customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By refining your automation processes and empowering agents with AI-driven insights, you can improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The right balance of AI and human touch can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance service speed and accuracy</strong>, delivering a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support agents</strong> in managing complex interactions, allowing them to excel where human intuition and problem-solving are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_4.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_4"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 4: The Art of the Possible</strong></span></h3>
<p>The final stage of the CX Maturity Journey envisions a fully integrated, AI-powered contact centre that proactively meets customer needs across all channels. In this future-ready environment, AI-driven systems predict and automate up to 90% of customer interactions, allowing human agents to focus on high-touch, complex cases that require empathy and expertise. This balance ensures that your customers receive the best of both worlds—efficient, automated support for simple requests and personalised, human service when it matters most.</p>
<p>A crucial element in this stage is ensuring that automation feels personal, not robotic. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can anticipate customer needs, offering tailored solutions in real time. This level of proactive support doesn’t just meet customer expectations—it exceeds them, creating deeper connections and fostering loyalty.</p>

At CloudInteract, we believe there’s no excuse for bad customer service. This philosophy, championed by our co-founder and CEO Simon Leyland, drives everything we do as we help businesses reimagine their customer interactions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, Simon will guide you through the evolving landscape of customer experience (CX), addressing the common challenges contact centres face when moving away from legacy infrastructure. We’ll also introduce you to our <span style=""color: #7d55c7;"">CX Maturity Journey</span>, a proven roadmap designed to help organisations transition from outdated, reactive systems to intelligent, AI-powered platforms capable of delivering proactive, personalised customer service.</p>
<p><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CX-and-Journey-Diagram.png"" width=""1760"" height=""1241"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CX-and-Journey-Diagram"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1760px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;""></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: Aileron; font-weight: 300; color: #c63db5;"">Understanding the Challenges of Legacy Systems</span></h3>
<p>Today, many contact centres remain stuck in the past—relying on fragmented systems that are not equipped to meet the expectations of today’s multi-channel, data-driven customer service. These outdated platforms are voice-centric, with limited capabilities for automation or integrated reporting. This not only stifles innovation but also leaves businesses disconnected from their customers.</p>
<p>At CloudInteract, we understand that CX transformation is more than just upgrading technology. It’s about evolving the way your contact centre operates, so it can respond to changing customer needs with greater agility and efficiency.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_1.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 1: Laying the Foundation</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most organisations begin their journey at this stage, where they operate with basic, often disjointed systems and minimal reporting capabilities. Customer interactions are reactive, and businesses focus heavily on managing costs rather than fostering innovation. The lack of integrated tools leads to a fragmented customer experience, with IT and business teams working in silos.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparate Systems:</strong> Multiple disconnected tools result in inconsistent service and limit the ability to innovate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Customer Insights:</strong> Without integrated systems, businesses struggle to gather and analyse data, leaving them without the insights necessary to deliver proactive service.</li>
<li><strong>High Dependency on Agents:</strong> Manual handling of customer interactions leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased agent burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By streamlining your infrastructure and integrating systems, you can overcome these challenges. This shift provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer data</strong> for deeper insights.</li>
<li><strong>Operational efficiencies</strong> by reducing manual workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time reporting</strong> for faster decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_2.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 2: Laying the Groundwork for Growth</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, organisations begin to realise the benefits of modern platforms. Moving to the cloud allows for greater flexibility, more connected systems, and the ability to generate real-time insights that can drive smarter decision-making. Automation begins to take hold, helping to streamline routine tasks and reduce the burden on agents.</p>
<p>Consider a recent example of a global healthcare company we worked with. They were heavily reliant on a legacy system, which cost millions annually and supported only voice interactions. Their challenge was to transition 1,000 agents to the cloud in under five months—while maintaining business continuity. Through a well-structured plan and leveraging cloud technologies, we helped them meet this tight deadline, dramatically cutting costs and vastly improving the system's flexibility.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlocking the Full Potential of Data:</strong> While systems may be more connected, businesses often lack the tools or expertise to make data actionable. Many miss opportunities to leverage automation effectively, which limits operational improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Manual and Automated Processes:</strong> As businesses begin automating tasks, it’s common for agents to still handle processes that could be automated, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By integrating systems and automating key processes like call summarisation and reporting, you can unlock the full potential of your data. This not only reduces operational costs but also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more accurate service</strong> through real-time data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Automation of repetitive tasks</strong>, freeing up agents to focus on more complex customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_3.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_3"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 3: Building an Intelligent, Automated Contact Centre</strong></span></h3>
<p>At this stage, the focus shifts to highly automated workflows powered by AI. With AI-enabled reporting and advanced system integration, contact centres can handle customer interactions more efficiently, reducing the need for manual agent intervention by up to 80%. This frees agents to focus on higher-value tasks that require human empathy and expertise.</p>
<p>For example, we worked with a professional services organisation that moved to cloud-based operations. After analysing thousands of customer interactions, they identified inefficiencies—like high call abandonment rates—that had previously gone unnoticed. With these insights, they rapidly implemented improvements that significantly enhanced both customer satisfaction and operational performance.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Key Challenges:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining the Balance Between Automation and Human Service:</strong> As automation increases, there’s a risk of losing the personal touch. It’s crucial to ensure that automation enhances, rather than replaces, the human empathy needed for complex cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring AI Delivers Value:</strong> AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Without proper data and processes, businesses risk deploying ineffective solutions that fail to improve customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong>Opportunities:</strong></span></p>
<p>By refining your automation processes and empowering agents with AI-driven insights, you can improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction. The right balance of AI and human touch can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance service speed and accuracy</strong>, delivering a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support agents</strong> in managing complex interactions, allowing them to excel where human intuition and problem-solving are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #cf389a;""><strong><img src=""https://145219679.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/145219679/CX%20Maturity%20Journey%20Assets/CI-Diagram-Circles_4.png"" width=""200"" height=""200"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""CI-Diagram-Circles_4"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Stage 4: The Art of the Possible</strong></span></h3>
<p>The final stage of the CX Maturity Journey envisions a fully integrated, AI-powered contact centre that proactively meets customer needs across all channels. In this future-ready environment, AI-driven systems predict and automate up to 90% of customer interactions, allowing human agents to focus on high-touch, complex cases that require empathy and expertise. This balance ensures that your customers receive the best of both worlds—efficient, automated support for simple requests and personalised, human service when it matters most.</p>
<p>A crucial element in this stage is ensuring that automation feels personal, not robotic. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can anticipate customer needs, offering tailored solutions in real time. This level of proactive support doesn’t just meet customer expectations—it exceeds them, creating deeper connections and fostering loyalty.</p>
